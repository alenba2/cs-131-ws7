Wiersebe has done a great job revising the English to make Pilgrim's Progress understandable to the modern American.  His revisions are done sparingly preserving the style of the original.<br />As a devout Evangelical himself Wiersbe has no agenda other than making the work understandable.  His notes and comments at the end of each section offer theological insights both true to Bunyan and true to the Scripture.<br /><br />If you are reading Pilgrim's Progress for you own edification or if you are teaching a class this is the best edition.
Thomas Sowell is undoubtedly one of America's great intellectual treasures.  Sowell offers an alternate explanation (compared to the politically-correct party line) about the lot of African Americans as well as beliefs about the Jewish and German peoples. He does this via 6 essays.<br /><br />His first essay \\"Black Rednecks and White Liberals\\" is first in placement and priority.  Sowell postulates that the \\"redneck\\" culutre actually originated in Ireland Scotland and the northern regions of England at a time when those areas were anything but civil and stable.  This violent culture was carried across the sea to our southern states (partly because the northerners refused them permission to settle up north). This became the \\"redneck culture\\" that dominated the south even before the Civil War characterized by lack of discipline out-of-wedlock births violence and taking pride in ignorance.<br /><br />Sowell argues that the Black value system is essentially the \\"red neck\\" value system and that Black language is essentially \\"red neck\\" language.  Whereas the Irish and Scottish left their uncultured lifestyles behind and whereas most southerners have done the same this \\"red neck\\" culture is not only propigated in the Black community it is celebrated.  But Sowell points out embracing the values of that culture sabotages any attempt to rise within society.  Fasicinating and extensively documented thoughts!<br /><br />The second essay \\"Are Jews Generic?\\" analyzes the blessings and plights of society's \\"middlemen.\\"  Great reading.<br /><br />The third essay is a fascinating one about \\"The Real History of Slavery.\\"  Sowell tells us that slavery was practiced on every continent toward every race and that it was the West which put an end to it around the globe.<br /><br />His chapter on \\"Germans and History\\" is a fair assessment of what happened during the Nazi years and the plight of scattered ethnic Germans after WWII.  A must read.<br /><br />Sowell's firth essay is titled \\"Black Education: Achievements Myths and Tragedies.\\"  Sowell is wise enough to ask the simple question \\"Why do educators refuse to look at the success stories of Black education and model programs after them?\\"<br /><br />His last essay \\"History versus Visions\\" talks about the rewriting of history and in many ways refers back to the first essay.<br /><br />Whether you agree completely with Sowell or not you will probably find this book thought provoking extremely reasoned tediously documented and interesting to read.  Sowell is a brilliant man who is capable of noting the obvious.

Lenski writes from a conservative Lutheran perspective and is therefore appreciated by most evangelical pastors and theologians. He is among that small company of \\"classical scholars.\\"  Although laymen could understand most of Lenski's comments this set is geared for the serious Bible student.  I appreciate Lenski's work for several reasons:<br /><br />(1) Although I do not always agree with him he evades nothing<br />(2) He often addresses several possibilities and settles on one in particular<br />(3) He brings up the Greek where helpful but does not chase rabbit trails<br />(4) His writing style can be characterized as concise and precise<br /><br />On the negative side he can be a bit too sure of himself and some volumes are not as useful to those of us who hold different eschatological positions (especially  Revelation).  Lenski holds distinctive Lutheran views about baptism and the Lord's Supper but his commentary is so excellent and enlightening that I have long ago forgiven him for these doctrinal differences (this is a tease from a non-Lutheran; I obviously have great respect for many conservative Lutheran scholars)!  Since the set was written in the 1930's and 1940's they do not address some of the most modern theological challenges but the overwhelming majority of challenges were already up and running in the 1930's so it is still very very helpful.<br /><br />I would not feel \\"properly armed\\" as an evangelical pastor without my Lenskis.
Volume 1 addresses the various (variegated) views held by the Jews during the second temple period about the relationship of the Law (nomism) to salvation (justifcation). It focuses on the era before and right after the time of Jesus. Understanding the views of this era help us with understanding the background of the New Testament.<br /><br />D.A. Carson one of today's greatest evangelical scholars has elicited the help of many scholars some evangelical others not; he is the editor of the two-part series but most of the material is provided by the illustrious contributors. The overall purpose of this two volume set is to refute the \\"Covenantal Nomism\\" (the view that \\"you get into the covenant by grace but you stay in it by keeping the Law\\") of E.P. Sanders. It also seeks to refute the \\"New Perspective\\" as to what Paul the Apostle really meant when he spoke of salvation \\"apart from the Law.\\" Volume one shows that Sanders erred: there is no one view that dominated all Jewish thought before the time of Christ (or shortly thereafter). Volume 2 then completes the project by demonstrating that the \\"New Perspective\\" may be \\"new\\" but it is not correct. The Reformers really did know what they were talking about.<br /><br />But whether you are debating the \\"New Perspective\\" or not you will find Volume I rich! You will sharpen your understanding of the thinking of the Jewish world from about 200 B.C. to about 100 A.D. You will delve into the Apocrypha the Pseudepigrapha the Talmud etc.; those who want to better understand the Jewish Roots of the Christian Faith will also appreciate this volume.<br /><br />Volume I is not intended for the average layman but a trained pastor can understand this work Although a few parts are dry other portions are absolutely fascinating.<br /><br />Does Volume I accomplish its goal? Absolutely.<br /><br />Volume II \\"The Paradoxes of Paul\\" address the issue \\"Did Paul really believe that one entered the covenant by grace (accepting Christ as opposed to Jewish birth) but then maintained his status in the covenant by keeping the Law?\\" The clear answer of this volume is \\"no.\\" We enter by grace and we are kept in the covenant by grace.<br /><br />A team of mostly evangelical scholars proves that \\"the works of the Law\\" refer not merely to the boundary markers of Judaism (circumcision etc.) but even to keeping the 10 Commandments. When Paul talks about salvation \\"apart from the works of the Law\\" he is saying more than \\"apart from becoming a Jew.\\" He is saying that the Law is good but when used in an attempt to be justified the Law cannot deliver. We are saved by grace through faith; God justifies the \\"ungodly\\" not the law keeper.<br /><br />The authors all respected scholars take us back to the clear teaching of Scripture. If we look at Paul without a pre-existing template they argue we find that law keeping has no (positive) bearing on salvation because no one can keep the law. Paul concludes us all \\"under sin.\\" Although obeying God evidences our forensic justification it does not accomplish it.<br /><br />As Moises Silva points out \\"Indeed faith is by definition the abandonment of our works and efforts so that we might rely solely on divine grace...\\"<br /><br />The various essays take us through the theological portion of Romans and Galatians with a few stops in Philippians 3.<br /><br />Besides addressing the issue of salvation by grace through faith in contrast to salvation by grace and works the authors also address the nature of the atonement the very real wrath of God that is directed toward mankind and both the continuity and discontinuity in Paul (before and after his conversion). They also address whether he really was converted or just received a specialized calling.<br /><br />With great scholars like Mark Seifrid Douglas Moo Peter O'Brien and D.A. Carson (among others) these essays are well done and devastating I would suppose to Covenantal Nomists.<br /><br />Onthe negative side because each chapter is an individual essay there is quite a bit of repetition within this work.<br /><br />Also worth mentioning is that this work is not intended for the layman. One could probably get by without Greek but the reader needs at least a modest theological background I would think to follow these arguments.lso worth mentioning is that this work is not intended for the layman.

The two-part series title \\"Justification and Variegated Nomism\\" means the various views (variegated) of the relationship of the Law (nomos) to justification (being declared righteous before God).<br /><br />Volume I of this series clearly evidenced that there was no one Jewish position regarding the relationship of law keeping to justification during the Second Temple era thus disproving the assumed uniformity of \\"Covenantal Nomism.\\"<br /><br />This volume \\"The Paradoxes of Paul\\" address the issue \\"Did Paul really believe that one entered the covenant by grace (accepting Christ as opposed to Jewish birth) but then maintained his status in the covenant by keeping the Law?\\"  The clear answer of this volume is \\"no.\\"  We enter by grace and we are kept in the covenant by grace.<br /><br />A team of mostly evangelical scholars proves that \\"the works of the Law\\" refer not merely to the boundary markers of Judaism (circumcision etc.) but even to keeping the 10 Commandments.

As a pastor of over 25 years I have used several books as part of a pre-marital counseling regiment. Drs. Les and Leslie Parrotts' books are the best by far! Not only do the Man's and Woman's Workbooks (I suggest ordering them with the book) make premaritial counseling simpler I have found that this book hits the nail on the head. Couples who went through the \\"Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts\\" material in preparation for marriage thanked me after they were married and they shared how valuable this material was in the daily grind of life.<br /><br />This volume adds additioanl material to address the compexities of a Blended Family.  Although blended family issues cannot be dealt with thoroughly the Parrotts share the most important considerations (and offer other resource suggestions on page 186 footnote 6).<br /><br />I first heard the authors at a Moody Pastor's Conference in the late 1990's. It did not take me long to determine that I would check out their books. I have since concluded that Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott are exceptional in the realm of understanding human relationships.<br /><br />Althogh the book is written by a godly Christian couple this is more of a relational book than a spiritual one so I would not consider it a complete pre-marital regiment but a good anchor book.  Couples already married (even for years)  will find this material valuable as well (and will kick themselves for not having read it earlier).<br /><br />Whether used in counseling or simply read by a couple in their own quest to prepare for marriage this book is a gem. The Drs. Parrott seem to have a realistic (and well documented) grasp on the nature of marriage and the additional complexities of bringing children into a new blended family. This is practical hands on material.<br /><br />The book is arranged around 9 questions:  Are you ready to get married again? Have you faced the myths of marriage with honesty? Can you identify your love style? Have you developed the habit of happiness? Can you say what you mean and understand what you hear? Have you bridged the gender gap? Do you know how to fight a good fight? Do you know how to blend a family? and Are you and your partner soul mates? This is basically the 7 questions from \\"Saving Your Marriage Before It Starts\\" with two additional questions added to tackle a blended family thus \\"Saving Your SECOND Marriage...\\"<br /><br />Of course no couple entering marriage could honestly answer all those questions with a \\"yes.\\" But the book provides a good start and helps couples begin to face reality and potential areas of growth.<br /><br />If a couple follows the exercises by purchasing the workbooks (like identifying some of your own personal \\"commandments\\"--rules you live by that you picked up who knows where and expect your spouse to know and agree with) it could preclude many potential tensions later.<br /><br />To those of you considering a second marriage go through this book together and cosider at least some of the exercises in the workbooks. To pastors and Christian counselors I urge you to read this volume and consider using it!u developed the habit of happiness? Can you say what you mean and understand what you hear?

Huntington's thesis is that the world is divided into several civilizations (Western Eastern Orthodox Sinitic Islamic etc.) and conflict is almost inevitable where these civilizations meet (as in the former Yugoslavia for example).  Additionally each civilization has a core nation that leads the way (in the case of the Islamic world it is Saudi Arabia).<br /><br />Although Huntington's work was written before 911 it's main thesis is still valid.  What is questionable is Huntington's viewpoint that Americans should be comfortable with losing influence and should operate as simply one of many nations.<br /><br />Since Huntington (who is obviously a true scholar and a professor at Harvard) was connected to the Clinton Administration his viewpoints refelect the posture of that administration. America is a different nation now than it was before 911 but we should not fault the author for failing to forsee the surprising change in our thinking as a result of the terrorist attacks.<br /><br />So as far as a vision for future policy this book has its weakenesses. But when it comes to understanding the WHY of conflict between civilizations this book excels. It also moves us away from the paradigm which focuses upon nations; rather we must learn to think in terms of civilizations.  In a sense 911 has already taken us to this point. Good book for the thoughtful reader.
This is a great \\"source book\\" about how kids feel about their parents' divorce visitation and their desperation for things to be \\"fixed.\\"  Each page contains a short letter written to a judge.  Some are a few sentencesothers a couple of paragraphs.<br /><br />This is a must read for divorced parents or anyone who counsels with or is in some way involved with children of divorce.<br /><br />The kids express the frustration of one parent being upset with them if they dared to say they had a good time while staying with the other parent constantly moving or parents who cannot treat their former spouses with common courtesy.<br /><br />Some of the entries might make you cry; a few of them are comical most of them simply sad.<br /><br />You'll see their fears (the greatest heartbreak of all) their anger their guilt (blaming themselves) their sense of helplessness and feeling ignored as divorced parents have an agenda to prove themselves the better of the two.<br /><br />Readers can probably finish this book in an hour; I read it a bit here and a bit there. Good book.

Pastors are sometimes stressed out about what to do with couples who want to marry but are already living together (or cohabiting couples who attend our churches).<br /><br />We end up with internal conflicts: on the one hand we want to be gracious; on the other we want to be true to God's Word.  On the one hand we should not expect lost people to act like Christians; on the other we should hold Christians accountable to a Biblical standard.<br /><br />It seems like whatever choice we make we feel guilty.<br /><br />Van Goethem has presented a thorough work that looks at the big picture.  Why is cohabitation so bad?  How is the marriage covenant superior not only morally but relationally and socially?  The author offers facts figures and statistics to bolster his assertions.<br /><br />Then the author addresses those sticky issues that plague clergy who take the Bible seriously.  Since so many people live in contradiction to God's revealed will how do we make the best of a wrong situation?  Van Goethem advocates that such couples must live separately (and purely) until the wedding if they want a truly Christian wedding.<br /><br />The author does not address all problems. It disappointed me that he acknowledged (but left unaddressed) situations involving children.  Is it better for mom and dad to separate or would that traumatize the children?  What if mom and dad cannot afford to separate should we then rush the wedding?<br /><br />Despite those significant omissions the book does address MOST of the situations we come across.  The appendices are worth the purchase price of the book: Cohabitaiton Facts and A Sample Church Wedding Policy are two of the four appendices that are especially helpful.<br /><br />If you want  a Biblical attempt to address these messy issues this is the book to get!<br /><br />Every evangelical pastor needs this one -hands down.
The Nephilim and the Pyramid of the Apocalypse deals with a fascinating subject and has its strong points but it could have been much better.  It's level of scholarship is limited and it assumes a lot though it does include a few good insights and can be understood by popular audiences.  I do agree with many of the author's major points.<br /><br />GOOD: I accept the basic premise that the \\"sons of God\\" in Genesis 6 were indeed fallen angels that they somehow were involved in genetic manipulation and that the \\"Nephilim\\" giants resulted (I think Jude and 2 Peter make this clear)<br /><br />BAD: BUT some of the author's claims are based upon faulty logic and inaccurate (or at best unsubstantiated) information.For example he uses a 25.025 inch cubit whereas the common cubit was 18 inches (the length of a man's arm from his elbow to the tip of his middle finger) or the royal cubit 20.5.  Don't know where he got the 25.025 inch one. He claims that if you do some fancy multiplication with the dimensions of the Great Pyramid you come up with 91840000 the exact number of miles from the earth to the sun (p. 12). But the unit we call a \\"mile\\" was not developed for millennia after the pyramid was built!  He does the same with inches (page 13).  He also refers to the year \\"zero\\" (there is no such year; we go from 1 B.C. to 1 A.D.)<br /><br />BAD: He accepts the questionable theory of the Bible code and theorizes that the ancient half-animal/half-man deities were actually genetic manipulations by the fallen angels. But if that is the case how come there is no mention of them in the Bible?  Such traumatic sights would surely have been referenced in Genesis or Exodus.  The suggestion that there are still Nephilim hiding out in remote areas seems incredible to me. And if the Pharaohs were giants why do we not find giant mummies?<br /><br />BAD: The author also believes that the Great Pyramid survived the Flood. This would be a problem for most creationist scientists who believe in the cataclysmic nature of the Flood.  This would require a period of de-population in Egypt and then a completely unrelated people (Noah's descendennts) taking up the old Egyptian religion and culture in a new environment (Egypt would not have been arid before the Flood).  Since the earth spoke only one language before Babel it was very unlikely Egyptian! So how could they take up where the ancient Egyptians left off?<br /><br />BAD: His arguments for the Nephilim are sometimes based on Greek words (like \\"Apollos\\") or Greek translations of the Hebrew Old Testament but the Greek language had not been developed until well after Babel not before the flood.<br /><br />GOOD: His viewpoint of the Gospel in the Stars (and especially his correlation with Revelation 12) has great merit.  Readers can pick up some important insights here. But in my opinion he overdoes it assigning unobvious meanings to too many constellations. Nonetheless if taken with reservation this section is informative.<br /><br />BAD: Additionally the author quotes the Apocryphal book of Enoch as though it were true (authoritative and trustworthy) though his only arguments for its trustworthiness are that it adds needed information and was quoted in Jude a poor criteria indeed.  The problematic quotation of Enoch in Jude is difficult but Bible-believing Christian Scholars do not accept Enoch as a trustworthy book (at least as we now have it).<br /><br />GOOD: Enoch's value is to give us an idea of what some Jews from the 3rd century B.C. believed and they certainly believed that the \\"sons of God\\" in Genesis 6 were fallen angels an important argument for the author's viewpoint.  This is its main value and it is an important consideration.<br /><br />GOOD: The author's beliefs about the Magi are well founded and quite possible (even probable); BUT he sets the date for Christ's birth about 3 B.C. and has the Magi visiting Herod in 2 B.C.  The problem is that scholars believe that Herod died in 4 B.C. Yet to those who have not heard about the origin of the Magi there is good information here.<br /><br />GOOD: It is reasonable to wonder whether the ancient heathen legends about the gods mating with women were distortions of what actually happened in Genesis 6 a point that the author addresses well.<br /><br />GOOD: Much of the book is a survey of Bible prophecy from a pretribulational dispensational viewpoint.  For someone who has never been given a crash course in end time prophecy this might be valuable and helpful.<br /><br />MISSING was the connection between the \\"sons of god\\" and the UFO phenomenon.<br /><br />OVERALL this book will certainly shed some light on the Nephilim for those who have never studied the subject but the author's logic and scholarship need some work.Magi there is good information here.

Joshua Evans wrote this book as a pre-teen and in it he explains (in a very short and succinctly way) the emotions and struggles of being shared between two divorced parents and the ups and downs of being shipped off for visitation.  He writes in brief sentences in a way that kids will love: from a child to a child.  For example he has a list of \\"Things that Make Me Sad\\" including \\"It makes me sad when my mom and dad say bad things about one another.\\"<br /><br />His message can be summarized as: don't live in denial but focus on the positive.  You have no say in much of what happens and your parents' problems are not your fault so focus on making the best of it.  The author innocently and candidly shares his feelings and (very sensible) conclusions.<br /><br />Parents who must share a child (or children) would do well to read this little book to better understand a child's perspective.<br /><br />Most of the book consists of fun games and ideas to help kids pass time while traveling long distances from parent to parent.  One example involves counting how many people you see (for example on a plane) have blond hair brown hair black hair red hair or are bald.  Another involves \\"mapping a room.\\"  Kids will love these downtime fillers.<br /><br />This type of book is freeing to children letting them know that the way they feel is normal.  They are not the only ones who have to deal with such struggles.  Rather than taking the role of the victim Joshua has chosen to do what he can and he has also chosen to make the best of what he cannot control (a good philosophy for all our lives).  His example (and his desire to help other kids) will undoubtedly influence others.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
Although Amazon presents this book as written by Haddon Robinson don't believe it! Robinson wrote only the introduction. The book was written by Alice Matthews a respeced Christian woman of God who has been associated with Radio Bible Class for example.<br /><br />Alice Matthews fills a void among conservative evangelical pastors: communicating and considering the women in the congregation when it comes to preaching the Word. While she does not address the other side of the equation namely to make Christianity acceptable as a masculine faith she presents the female perspective.<br /><br />This book varies in quality from chapter to chapter.  Some chapters are tremendous others scrape bottom reflecting a sort of \\"1975\\" mentality.  Yet the good chapters are so excellent that I must rate it with five stars.<br /><br />The first chapter \\"Is It True That Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus?\\" downplays the differences between the genders.  Matthews takes a moderate position that differences exist but are often exaggerated. Unfortunately she avoids crucial information such as the physical differences in male and female brains.  The tendency to minimize heredity and maximize the effects of environment evidences the author's viewpoint  (that's part of what I mean by a \\"1975\\" mentality; even Dobson now says that over 60% of our personal behavior is heredity).<br /><br />The second chapter \\"Preaching for Moral Decision-Making\\" is worth the price of the book. She demonstrates how women are more prone to make decisions based on their effect upon others (looking for win-win situations) while men are more concerned about following the rules (no matter what the consequences).  She demonstrates that God sometimes addressed matters one way (the male way) while other times taking the more feminine approach (emphasizing right-relatedness). Good thought provoking insights.<br /><br />Chapter three was the book's low point.  Relying on antiquated studies the author implies that the reason more Christian women seek psychological counseling is because preaching is not addressing their needs (bottom of p. 47 top of 48).  Matthews gives too much credit to preaching and too little credit to the nature of dysfunctional people. She additionally quotes the politically correct reports that blame marriage for female depression despite recent studies that show married women are happier than single women. This section is filled with assumptions and logical fallacies. In this bleak section there are a few good insights (p. 53 is an example) where many men are said to look at people as those who fill needs whereas women focus more on the individuals than their roles. There is an awful lot of subtle male bashing in chapter 3. But don't let this chapter turn you off to the whole book.<br /><br />Chapters 4 and 5 are out of this world.  We leave the 1970's mentality behind here and we look at epistemology (\\"How Do We Know\\") and \\"Modern and Post Modern Listening.\\"  These chapters talk about the different mentalities women may have.  Although the author admits the difficulty of preaching in a way that addresses ALL these mentalities simultaneously the information found here is very useful.  Fascinating material here.<br /><br />Chapter 6 \\"Women Spirituality and Issues of Faith\\" explain a lot of what I have observed in over 25 years of pastoral ministry.  \\"Subjective Knowers\\" for example have always gotten on my nerves.  The reason: they do not consider themselves obligated to follow any external authority.  On the other hand I relate best to procedural learners because they think in ways more consistent with my thinking.  Explains much.<br /><br /> Chapter 7 \\"Women and Issues of Power\\" not only helps us to understand female views of power but it also challenges the perspective of many (not all) men.  In chapter 7 one is left with the impression that the female viewpoint about power is the better viewpoint in a church context.  Whereas men often feel they are losing power if they share it women tend to think that power is increased as it is shared.  Of course there have always been men who were into sharing power and some women are power gluttons (the author acknowledges she is speaking in generalities).  So many men NEED this chapter!<br /><br />Chapter 8 on leadership is pretty weak. Chapter 9 on \\"Women Roles and Identity\\" is mixed.  On the one hand Matthews argues reasonably that we need to respect single women.  Yet we see some of the jumps and assumptions here that plague the book.  For example \\"American women grow up of thinking of motherhood as central...\\" Is this really an American phenomenon?  How about maternal instinct?  The brain? Genes?  Again the author buys into the 1975 view that we are mostly products of environment.<br />I would argue that it is natural in ANY society for women to want to one day be mothers.  It is unnatural when such is not the case.<br /><br />Chapter 10 closes with some good practical advice.  I especially appreciate this statement: \\"How a preacher feels about non-Christians economic issues or people of a different race or social status comes through (consciously or otherwise) in the metaphors and illustrations used in a message.  That also holds true for a minister's attitudes toward women...\\" I am convinced of that!<br /><br />So all in all a book worth getting that will help male pastors better understand the women in the congregation.  The bigger problem might be that the men who need this most are least likely to read it!hat power is increased as it is shared.

Although this is out of print it is worth obtaining particularly for teachers of the Word. Wiersbe takes the 7 Feasts out of moth balls and presents them in a fascinating way.<br />Wiersbe is Biblical theologically conservative and writes simply and clearly for the lay person.  Although easy to understand and brief the truths contained in this volume are gigantic.<br /><br />In short Wiersbe correlates the Festivals to NT truth:<br />Passover: Christ died for our sins<br />Unleavened Bread: The Holy Messiah makes His people holy<br />Firstfruits: Christ arose the first fruits of them that sleep<br />Pentecost: The coming of the Holy Spirit<br />Trumpets: The return of Christ (rapture)<br />Day of Atonement: The end time repentance of Israel<br />Tabernacles: The feast of the Millennium<br /><br />A great place to start looking at this fascinating subject.  Also useful for Bible teachers.  Wiersbe is the king of clear presentation.
If you have never studied the Old Testament Feasts you might think they would make for dull study.  I did for many years.  But I have found this one of the most fascinating areas to study in the entire Bible!  This book is a great place to begin.<br /><br />This fine work is great for a general read or as a useful tool for Bible teachers.  It is written from a solidly evangelical perspective the kind of viewpoint we expect from the publisher Friends of Israel.  It is clear and thorough but not tedious.  It describes the natue of the 7 Feasts of Leviticus as well as the Sabbath and the Minor Feasts.<br /><br />The author begins with and always considers himself accountable to the Bible.  Additionally he explains the Jewish customs and understanding of the Festivals and then demonstrates how some of the aspects of the festivals foreshadow the Messiah or New Testament truths.<br /><br />The volume is filled with Scripture references (and thus well documented) and takes a respectful approach toward the Jewish roots of our Chrisitan beliefs as well as a belief that God has a future for the nation of Israel.<br /><br />Lots of solid doctrine.  The insights and implications of the Feasts are a fascinating read for anyone dedicated to understanding the faith of the Bible or growing deeper in the Lord.<br /><br />My only gripe is that the author follows the traditional Jewish practice of lumping the first three Levitical feasts together: Passover Unleavened Bread and First Fruits (since they occur within the same week).  Separate treatment would have been better in my view.  But all in all a fine faith-building volume!
This timely books addresses a growing challenge in our society: the need to aquire good social skills and manners.<br /><br />June Hines Moore addresses everything from table manners to conversation to job interviews to proper attire.  It is particularly geared for young adults.<br /><br />This would also be useful curriculm for teaching youth about social skills.  Parents could use this with their childrenetc.<br /><br />Social skills in our society are at an all time low.  Between broken families computer/video absorption and perhaps a host of other reasons young adults are in dire need of clearcut guidance and direction.  You will find it here.<br /><br />Incidentally many adults who are no longer \\"young\\" could still pick up a number of pointers from this material.  Highly recommended.
This book is a helpful  study tool and reference work for  Jewish Messianic Jewish and Christian students of the Torah (the first five books of the Bible or the Books of Moses).  Its goal is to offer comments from the ancient Rabbis whose teachings have been preserved in the Talmud (a massive collection of Rabbinic sermons from shortly after the time of Christ and for several centuries afterward). It is a reference work not the sort of book one would read from cover to cover.<br /><br />This volume should not be considered a thorough Talmudic commentary on the Torah (it is only 382 pages and the font is large).  Instead the author chooses a few signficant verses from  various Torah chapters and then provides some relevant quotations about that passage from the Talmud.<br /><br />The commentary is arranged in biblical order It is a real help in understanding the ancient Jewish understanding (or application) of many passages in the Torah and the choice of passages addressed seems reasonable.<br /><br />The Talmudic comments both highlight the unusual interpretive style of ancient Judaism yet they sometimes provide reasonable insights along with the allegorizations.  Either way the reader will begin to understand the mentality of Second Temple and post 70 A.D. Judaism.<br /><br />The section addressing the Yom Kippur Service (pp. 174-176) is especially excellent.<br /><br />As an evangelical Christian pastor I would recommend this book for serious students of the Torah.
This book is valuable to help students of Scripture see the pattern of each Old Testament book.  The author provides us with symmetrical outlines typically providing a \\"Center Point\\" which is th emphasis or \\"pinnacle\\" of the section. But the arrangement is not just his creation: it really fits the organization of the book under study. This outline exemplifies an orderly arrangement called chiasmus (or chiasm). It looks something like this: A B C Center Point C' B' A'  And most of the Old Testament typically does indeed (naturally) flow into this pattern.<br /><br />This work is useful in two ways:<br />(1) hermeneutically (interpretationally) it shows us where the climax of the section is located and how the symmetrical pattern before and after it modifies that climax;<br />(2) instructionally (for preaching or teaching) it directs us to a concentration point.  This is useful in many ways but it is particularly helpful when we are addressing highlights from the various books of the Old Testament.<br /><br />This is not the type of book one would read through but it is a reference book to pull off the shelf when a person is preparing to study a particular book of the Old Testament.  I would include this volume under the label of \\"introductory material.\\" Although it is subtitled as a \\"commentary\\" it is not a verse by verse work but rather a commentary on the main structure (and outline) of the books involved.  The book is slightly more than 300 pages long.<br /><br />The average laymen would probably not find this book very useful but folks interested and active in Bible teaching (particuarly at an adult level) would probably enjoy this work.
These monologues are brief (under 5 minutes?) and capture the flavor of the Bible characters.  They are great to use as part of a church service to add a little Christmas or Easter flavor for example.<br /><br />I or others have simply read them (sometimes in costume) and they went over well.  Churches with extensive drama teams will probably not find these useful.  But small and medium churches with small or no drama groups could find these a great way to demonstrate the value of drama.<br /><br />If you are looking for another \\"layer\\" for church services this is a great place to start.  Also useful for camp presentations as a short devotional etc.<br /><br />From a Biblical viewpoint the author takes few liberties but adheres pretty closely to Biblical information.
This is a very short book with scores of converstation-starting questions.<br /><br />As a pastor I have leant out this volume on a number of occasions to help couples who find it difficult to make conversation.  The couples who used it reported improvement.<br /><br />Besides setting the tone for meaningful conversations (by offering a discussion question or statement like \\"What is your favorite...?\\") it teaches how to start conversation by example.<br /><br />If you use this in conjunction with Gabor's book on \\"How to Start A Conversation\\" and Backus book \\"Telling Each Other the Truth\\" couples could make good progress in this area.
As a pastor who counsels many couples I have found this book useful to help women face the realities about the male of the species.  I have seen marriages rejuvinated in certain instances.<br /><br />Although the author could have been more tactful he brings home the real facts of life about men and particularly the importance of frequent sex for men.  True not all men fit Leman's mold but most do.  Of course men will not always admit to being as Leman describes becasue they fear their wives will reject them.<br /><br />The genders have to learn to accept one another even if they really cannot understand one another.<br /><br />This is not a cure all for all marriage problems but it will help enhance many marriages. If nothing else women will read a real-life explanation as to how most men work.  Whether they believe it or not is another issue.
Gibson's book documents the bitter and resentful attitude many nations have toward the U.S.  Most of us are aware that France and the Arab nations despise the U.S. but Gibson documents the awful attitudes of the Canadians Germans and Belgians.  Even Britain struggles to remain supportive of America.<br /><br />Gibson offers proof of this hatred through quoting the leaders of these nations and citing example articles from major newspapers and publications in those nations.<br /><br />His analysis of why other nations hate the U.S. is straightford: jealousy envy arrogance (especially France) and fear of being left out of decision making.  In his last chapter \\"They're Wrong We're Right. Get Used to It\\" Gibson summarizes: \\"In fact fun is a major element of anti-Americanism around the world.  People love hating America.  It makes them feel better about themselves; it gives them a villain to root against.\\"<br /><br />This book is definitely a good read!
This book is not meant for casual reading (you have to think to understand this one) but it can help enlighten the casual reader (who does not want to study) if he/she skims through the first 90 pages (which require some study of terms and differences)and then coasts through the rest. Geisler and Brooks are Christian thinkers who understand thinking and logic and they present the major components of logical thinking in a Christian context.<br /><br />The authors explain syllogisms and differentiate between a valid conclusion and an invalid conclusion. They also distinguish validity from actual truth (valid conclusions are not always actually true in reality; they are merely logically based on the premises presented).  That's the stuff addressed in the first 90 pages.<br /><br />But the best part (and most enjoyable for me)began with chapter 6 \\"Informal Fallacies.\\"  This section was lighter reading. Since this is an election year it would be a study in itself to compare political commentaries and supposed answers to questions with the logic presented in this volume!<br /><br />Since the authors are serious students of Scripture and Geisler is a celebrated Theologian most of their examples come from familiar Bible texts or theological issues. Although I have stronger convictions about Sovereign Grace than do the authors I really found their examples useful in the realm of hermenutics (Bible interpretation). They are solid defenders of an inerrant Bible and ethical interpretation.<br /><br />If you want to brush up your thinking skills this might be a good place to start. \\"Fit Bodies Fat Minds\\" by Os Guiness persuades us that the use of the mind has been neglected in evangelical communities and Geisler and Brooks have written a work to help properly activate those little grey cells. Not really an easy read and not for everyone but a meaningful mind stretcher.
I usually gobble up \\"Jewish Roots\\" books and have generally not been disappointed.  Shullam's book while offering some helpful material was a let down.<br /><br />First of all his theology is not within the evangelical camp.  He holds to salvation by faitfulness and baptism (which translates to salvation by faith plus works). Repeatedly throughout the volume when he comments on Paul's doctrine of salvation by faith he interprets it as \\"by faithfulness (through baptism)...\\"  So it is pretty obvious he has an agenda that blinds him to the true nature of grace.  He takes a few verses from Romans 6 and uses that as a template for the entire book rather than progressing forward and trying to follow Paul's flow of thought.<br /><br />His handling of Romans 8:30ff is absolutely awful and completely unsatisfying. The passage obviously deals with all \\"who love God and are called according to His purpose\\" (i.e. individually elected to salvation); Shullam claims these verses deal with Israel's election (a subject that does not come up until later in Romans).  Terrible.<br /><br />Secondly the quotations from Jewish sources rely heavily upon the Qumran Community (aka \\"The Dead Sea Scroll People\\").  Although many scholars (especially liberal ones) believe that John the Baptist and Jesus were heavily influenced by the Qumran Community because they do not believe that either of them taught anything unique or original most conservatives reject this. Although it is possible that this isolated community did affect the Jewish mentality they were not main players in Jewish life in the first century (which is why they are never referred to in the Gospels).  Brad Young in his book \\"Jesus the Jewish Theologian\\" makes the point on pages 15-16 (if you happen to own it).<br /><br />Some of the quotations from the Apocrypha are enlightening as are some from the Mishnah and Talmud; but most of them do nothing to amplify the text and as I mentioned the frequently quoted Qumran texts are of debatable worth.<br /><br />For Jewish roots information I would recommed David Stern's New Testament Commentary as being on more solid footing.  Though Stern does not offer the massive amount of material that Shullam does the material he does offer is more to the point.<br /><br />For readers who already have several good commentaries on Romans I would recommed purchasing this book because it will add an occasionally useful insight from an acient Jewish source so it is not a complete waste.  It was simply a disappointment to me because I have found other material from the Lederer publisher to be of great value.ted Qumran texts are of debatable worth.  <br /> <br />For Jewish roots information I would recommed David Stern's New Testament Commentary as being on more solid footing.

I cannot recommend this book highly enough.  It is an ideal commentary for pastors professors and serious laymen. If you can only afford one commentary on Romans make it this one.<br /><br />Serving as a pastor for over 25 years I have either taught or preached through Romans on several occasions.  As I was sharing my plans to tackle Romans yet another time my good friend ( a fellow pastor with degrees from Moody Dallas and Trinity) said \\"Ed you have to get Stott's commentary.  It is the best.  I just did Romans and bought Stott's when I was half-way through.  Wish I had it the whole time.\\"  Since my pal hesitates making recommendations and does not inflate matters I knew it had to be good.  I took my friend's word and was not disappointed. It was better than I imagined.  Much better than Hodge Lenski Newell and a host of others.  Not tedious or tangent-prone like some of the mega-sets.<br /><br />Stott is first and foremost an interpretter.  He addresses possibilities and then draws his conclusion.  He is solid conservative believes in sovereign grace and truly seeks to understand the original intent of the author.  His purpose is to interpret correctly not to twist texts to fit an agenda.<br /><br />He is thorough yet not tedious; understandable but not simplistic; concise but not cold.  The commentary is 406 pages (not including the study guide at the end) but the print is large and easy on the eye.  The many Scripture references are footnoted at the bottom of each page (making them easy to find) as are other references but they take up little space at the bottom.  There are no tedious explanatory notes footnoted; all you need is in the text itself.<br /><br />If you are a Bible-believing Christian this volume is the one to get.
David Lieberman has written a practical book that gets down to the bottomo of addressing many personal conflicts. He understands that the real issue is Self-esteem. When a person feels his or her self-esteem threatened conflict emerges. When a person's self-esteem is protected conflict is lessened or resolved.<br /> The first three chapters though short are worth the purchase price of the book. One interesting quotation typical of the first few chapters reads as follows: \\"The barometer that determines how annoyed frustrated or angered we become with others in any given situation is based on the degree to which we feel in control of ourselves and our lives. Our respect for ourselves in short determines (a) the amount of respect we crave from others and (b) our need to push for control and dominance.\\"<br /><br /> Lieberman offers some very practical advice to help readers address a variety of conflict situations providing simple but effective illustrations from real life examples.<br /><br /> As a seasoned pastor (over 25 years in the ministry) who has been involved in all sorts of conflict situations I have deduced a number of principles (explained clearly by Lieberman) over the years the hard way through the school of hard knocks. Wish this book was around years earlier.<br /><br /> On the negative side the author makes unrealistic promises in some of the chapter's sub-titles and even the title of the book is somewhat deceptive \\"Make Peace with Anyone.\\" Yet in the text itself the author clearly states that some situations have no real solutions. The book would be better if it did not promise complete success in all situations.<br /><br /> I also have a few ethical problems with the book. Lieberman in some instances advocates lying. Then in the last chapter he claims that the Bible advocates lying to end conflict an assertion I challenge. Relathionships that cannot espouse truth are not worth maintaining. Addtionally when one discovers that another has lied a greater conflict can emerge.<br /><br /> Lieberman also encourages saying nice things about the offended person to a third party so that it gets back around. That just doesn't sit well with me.<br /><br /> On the other hand people do need to feel listened to and respected and Lieberman shines in that department. It is great to ask others for advice and that seems a more legitimate measure to show the offended party that we do indeed respect them (unless we in fact do not!).<br /><br /> He also claims that the Bible teaches Aaron was more popular than Moses because Aaron counseled couples separately when they were having marriage problems (p.108). I have never seen anything even resembling that in Scripture; perhps he confuses the Bible with Talmudic Jewish tradition.<br /><br /> Although Lieberman constantly reinforces his warning not to use these techniques to manipulate others or out of insincere motives no doubt some will try. But that is not the author's fault: he seems to have a truly humble attitude; those who thusly abuse his advice will find that insincere application of his techniques will backfire.

As the pastor of a church with an average attendance of 200 our church board decided that it was time for us to consider hiring a second pastoral staff member.  We had little idea of what to look for in a second staff member. So I purchased this book to find some direction and I was not disappointed.<br />McIntosh offers some clear opinions that were helpful and well reasoned. Ideally the second staff member should be someone very different from the senior pastor.  The idea is to compliment him not replicate him.<br />The first four chapters touched on this subject. He did seem to lean too much for my liking upon the opinions of Lyle Schaller (who writes from a mainline denominational viewpoint; Schaller knows his stuff but there are significant differences between the needs of a typical mainline church and a church in an evangelical denomination or an independent evangelical church; conservative churches generally tend to be more active and pastors are less like chaplains but more creative and aggressive than their liberal counterparts hence they need additional staff earlier). McIntosh does not seem to communicate this distinction (of course he may just disagree with me:).<br />The book's title and subtitle truly communicate the nature of the volume. It deals with two distinct subjects: finding the right staff member(s)which occupies the lesser portion of the bookand working with and nurturing staff the majority of the book.<br />The latter part virtually ignores staffs with two or three pastors but assumes a large church format. Okay you can't make everyone happy. But I still did not like that (there I feel better).<br />Although I skimmed through the latter section it did seem to offer advice that could be adapted to smaller situations.  You will enjoy the book greatly if you are a staff or board member from a congregation with a large staff; if you are simply looking for good advice about what to look for in a second staff member you will find the first few chapters quite relevant but will probably not finish the book.<br />All in all a good book.e first few chapters quite relevant but will probably not finish the book.<br />All in all a good book.
David Payne has written a balanced commentary useful for pastors teachers or serious students of Scripture.  It is conservative does a fine job of interpretting the text without becoming tedious (sticks with English) and is exceptionally strong in drawing out principles for application.<br />If you are familiar with I and II Samuel you are aware of the complex web of relationships within the book. Payne untangles them and provides clarity and solid analysis.<br />As a pastor of 25 years I have preached through I and II Samuel on three occasions and I have found this to be the most helpful of my commentaries.  Highly recommended.
What it means to be a &quot;gentlemen&quot; is always a matter of opinion.  But John Bridges offers us a well-balanced path addressing most areas of life in a brief 150 page book filled with brief statements such as &quot;A gentlemen never tells jokes that may embarass other people even if those other people are not in the room.&quot;  The entire book is made up of similar directive sayings (no paragraphs) which is fine with me.  It gets the authors points across quickly and clearly.<br />The chapter titles include A Gentlemen Experiences Real Life A Gentlemen Gets Dressed A Gentlemen Goes to Dinner A Gentlemen Says the Right Thing A Gentlemen Gives A Party A Gentlemen Goes to A Party A Gentlemen and His Friends A Gentlemen Goes to the Office A Gentlmen Gets Equipped and Extreme Etiquette: A Gentlemen Faces the Really Big Challenges.<br />I was very satsified with this book and highly recommend it.
As I looked over the reviews of this book I noted a real polarization: guys either loved or hated this book.  Any book this polarizing I thought must at bare minimum be bold. And this is a bold book.<br /><br />On the positive side the basic premise that men need to embrace masculinity instead of apologizing for it is great.  It is true that many (unfortunately Eldredge says \\"the church\\" which is tough to prove since he has not been in every church) churches do embrace a feminized Jesus and seem to push an agenda that feminizes men.  As a pastor of 25 years I have noted this tendency in many (perhaps most?) congregations (but I can honestly say that this has not been the case in the two churches I have pastored).  Though common this problem is not always present.<br /><br />Eldredge argues that men should feel free to be \\"wild at heart\\" and that a deep relationship with God and the security that comes from realizing one is truly a man is a key to a satisfying and meaningful life for a man.<br /><br />He recognizes the \\"wound\\" that men have the importance of having a battle to fight and a beauty to rescue themes dealt with about ten or (or more) years ago (by the likes of Gordon Dalbey Robert Hicks etc.); but his work is a current volume and this material needs to re-circulate for the upcoming generations.<br /><br />On the negative side however this book is reactionary.  It addresses all men as though they were of the same temperament namely that of the author. Besides watching way too many movies the author enjoys the great outdoors.  But he has forgotten that God does not only bless the Esaus but also the Jacobs. And some of us guys don't even like movies (sorry but there is nothing masculine about having to be entertained visually). Many men have died for their country saved lives reared masculine sons and feminine daughters and been bold warriors for the kingdom on God and yet did not enjoy repelling or hunting. I fear we learn a lot about John Elderedge and about men LIKE him (and there are manyperhaps even a narrow majority although I wonder) than men in general; those of us who love the great \\"indoors\\" are virtually ignored or relegated to a category (by default) as less than masculine (although I do love the outdoors just not hunting or repelling; I am a hiker).<br /><br />The author is unusually weak in Bible interpretation but he is no heretic. He does however point out that Adam stood silently alongside Eve while she ate of the fruit (he gives credit to \\"The Silence of Adam\\" by Larry Crabb); on that interpretation he is right on.  And that is a key and crucial thought. He is weak in the interpretation department elsewhere throughout the book. Unfortunately many of his points come from popular movies great illustrations for the men who probably need the book most (those who live life vicariously through movies and TV).  But again a segment of us (who would rather play cards or take our wives dancing rather than tube out) were left out.<br /><br />The first half of the book disenchanted me; the second half was much better and worth the reading.  His comments about spiritual warfare need contemplation.<br /><br />For men who have temperaments like Elderedge (the restless deep feeling and aggressive kind) or who have been stifled and intimidated by a feminized version of Christianity this book is bold and radical enough to wake you out of your stupor. But it is not an \\"on the mark\\" response but a reactionary (and overly emotional) one.  If that's what floats your boat you'll love it. If you are a bit more laid back (like myself and many other guys) you will not enjoy this book as much. Of course if you are a passive wimp you NEED this book whether you will like it or not!<br /><br />Some other books I would recommend (as better) in this genre include Gordon Dalbey's \\"Father and Son\\" Robert Hicks \\"The Masculine Journey\\" (if you can find it; this is an excellent book) andRobert Lewis' \\"Raising A Modern Day Night\\" (on bringing up boys).  To my way of thinking these are less reactionary and right on the mark.<br /><br />So is this a good book or a bad one?  It is certainly not a bad book. And though it is not truly Scripturally based it is not heretical (just extra-scriptural).  If you share common frustrations and experiences with John Elderege you may find really enjoy it.  For many guys this would be good medicine; for others of us it is at least thought provoking.of thinking these are less reactionary and right on the mark.  So is this a good book or a bad one?

Not only does our brain influence our behavior our behavior and the choices we make influence the very structure of our brains!  This is the basic proposition of Restak's work and his documentation of that proposition is convincing.<br />Although the brain is a complicated and technical subject Restak writes for the layman and explains how our choices (e.g. viewing violent movies choosing to practice an instrument with diligence or even enjoying humor and laughter) affects our brains -- physically.<br />Modern research has proven that the brain has much more plasticity (flexibility and ability to change) throughout life (not just during youth) than previously believed.<br />Although Restak does not give enough credit to inherited abilities and tendencies (in my opinion he needs to address studies among identical twins raised apart) it is still interesting to note how practice and discipline actually change the brain's structure.<br />My favorite portion addresses how images (TV movies photos etc.) destabilize our brains and how that watching a fictional event is processed by our brain as an actual event.  The result is that portrayals of violence make us stressed fearful and more prone to be violent ourselves almost as though we had participated in the acutal events portrayed.<br />He addresses music ethical issues involving medication and leaves us with predictions about new medical treatments involving melding the brain with modern technology.<br />All in all this was an interesting and informative read.  Great for anyone who deals with people or is concerned about social issues.
As a pastor of 25 years I have used several books as part of a pre-marital counseling regiment. This is the best by far!  Not only do the Man's and Woman's Workbooks (I suggest ordering them with the book) make premaritial counseling simpler I have found that this book hits the nail on the head.  Couples who went through the material in preparation for marriage thanked me after they were married and they shared how valuable this material was in the daily grind of life.<br />I first heard the authors at a Moody Pastor's Conference in the late 1990's.  It did not take me long to determine that I would check out their books.  I have since concluded that Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott are exceptional in the realm of understanding human relationships.<br />Althogh the book is written by a godly Christian couple this is more of a relational book than a spiritual one so I would not consider it a complete pre-marital regiment but a good anchor book.<br />Whether used in counseling or simply read by a couple in their own quest to prepare for marriage this book is a gem.  The Drs. Parrott seem to have a realistic (and well documented) grasp on the nature of marriage. This is practical hands on material.<br />The book is arranged around 7 questions:  Have you faced the myths of marriage with honesty?  Can you identify your love style? Have you developed the habit of happiness?  Can you say what you mean and understand what you hear?  Have you bridged the gender gap?  Do you know how to fight a good fight? and Are you and your partner soul mates?<br />Of course no couple entering marriage could honestly answer all those questions with a &quot;yes.&quot;  But the book provides a good start and helps couples begin to face reality and potential areas of growth.<br />If a couple follows the exercises by purchasing the workbooks (like identifying some of your own personal &quot;commandments&quot;--rules you live by that you picked up who knows where and expect your spouse to know and agree with) it could preclude many potential tensions later.<br />This book could also be used as a marriage enrichment manual.  Indeed many couples (perhaps most) have probably failed to incorporate these solid principles.  Indeed several couples I counseled have identified this exercise as having made a significant difference in their marriages.<br />To those of you considering marriage go through this book together and cosider at least some of the exercises in the workbooks. To pastors and Christian counselors I urge you to read this volume and consider using it!know and agree with) it could preclude many potential tensions later.<br />This book could also be used as a marriage enrichment manual.

Margin is a crucial book for any serious Christian.  In a day of pushing the envelope Swenson urges us to leave room (&quot;margin&quot;) for the unexpected (and to reduce stress).<br />Many believers schedule their time to the hilt live within their credit limit rather than their means and displace time with family and God with good things but not the most important things.<br />Although Swenson himself an M.D. practices what he preaches he does perhaps go a little overboard in some areas (resisting buying a computer wearing a watch etc.).  But all in all he argues for balance and sanity to replace the rat race many Christians join.  He gives the reader permission to be counter-cultural.  He asks us if we could imagine Jesus leaving the Last Supper because His pager went off!<br />As a pastor of 24 years I have used this book to help me manage my own life. I have shared its Biblical insights from the pulpit and used this material extensively in my counseling ministry.  This is truly a &quot;must read&quot; book.  It is a life changer.
I have benefited from the ministry of Rick Warren since 1989.  As a matter of fact I went to his \\"Purpose Driven Church\\" seminar in Indianapolis in about 1995.  Although I have carefully selected which of Warren's suggestions to use in our ministry here I do have great respect for the man.<br />His new book \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" has been the number one best seller on the New York Times Best-Seller list and seems destined to be used of God to both deepen believers and reach seekers.<br />If you have been through a meaty discipleship program (Campus Crusade IV Navigators) or are a well-read Christian  you might not learn anything new from Warren's book but you will appreciate the concise way he deals with so many issues of the Christian life. I bought this volume to see if I might use it for discipleship or teaching.<br />The book is already becoming a fad in the evangelical community. Churches are teaching Sunday School lessons doing 40 day programs or coordinating preaching schedules with its chapters. I recommend this book DESPITE the fact that it is a fad (I usually detest fads because they are almost always shallow or lopsided). This volume though very simple is filled with meaningful content. It doesn't take you in depth into any subject but presents an important overview and addresses the basics in each area. Since many believers struggle with seeing the big picture or the whole picture this book will fill yet another void.<br />The five major purposes of the Christian life as understood by Warren include \\"You Were Planned for God's Pleasure\\" (Warren is right on here) \\"You Were Formed For God's Family You Were Created to Become Like Christ You Were Shaped for Serving God and You Were Made for a Mission.\\" These chapters are then subdivided providing forty short chapters in all (the reader is encouraged to read one chapter per day). I especially appreciated his view that we exist to glorify God and although I disagree with some of his terminology his perspective on worship is great.<br />This book would be wonderful to give a new believer but it will also \\"bring to remembrance\\" important truths no believer should ever get over. The most basic truths are always the most important ones and we should never leave them behind in the search for depth.<br />On the negative side I have four gripes: (1) Warren uses some of the strangest Bible translations out there; I have a number of verses memorized that he \\"quotes\\" but the paraphrases are so far removed from the original that I cannot even recognize them; (2) Warren quotes or uses illustrations from religious people who are not evangelical and readers may infer that he approves of their theological views (or that it really doesn't matter what you believe) (3) what Warren doesn't say can also be misleading. I appreciate his positive spirit but he fails to qualify many of his teachings. For example he emphasizes that Christians should stay put and not meander from church to church; however he does not note important exceptions (e.g. bad doctrine or unethical leadership). I am not saying Warren would advocate staying in a bad church (he would not) but it sounds like he does advocate this because he of what he fails to say (the silence is deafening); and (4)he does not deal with learning to depend upon the Holy Spirit and what that means.<br />Warren is actually a Southern Baptist and his doctrinal views align pretty well with many evangelicals including mine. He has written a book that will be a powerful force for the kingdom in the days ahead. I encourage all Christians to pick up this book. Some will find it fills in gaps; others will find it \\"brings to remembrance\\" important truths; but because of this book's major significance we also need to read it as participants in the broader Body of Chirst.<br />This book would make a great gift both for Christians and for those even somewhat open to the Gospel.his terminology his perspective on worship is great. <br />This book would be wonderful to give a new believer but it will also \\"bring to remembrance\\" important truths no believer should ever get over.

Barackman has compiled a concise but thorough practical theology that outlines matters of both doctrine and practice. Unlike multi-volume works this book puts doctrine at your fingertips.  Although multi-volume works may be more detailed none are more \\"packed\\" nor less intimidating.  I use this for lesson preparation I bought copies for each of my elders and I give a copy to those I have discipled or want to develop more deeply.  This book needs to get into the hands of our church leaders but pastors will also get a lot of use from this one.<br /><br />The author is Pre-millennial Dispensational eteranlly secure and holds to inerrancy. Pastors/laymen from Bible Churches Ev. Free Churches Baptist Grace Brethren and numerous other evangelical/fundamental denominations and fellowships will probably agree with the doctrinal and practical content of this work. As a graduate of Moody Bible Institute I find this book very much in line with sound doctrine.<br /><br />Do not be deceived: though this is only one volume and concise it strikes me as quite scholarly. A truly helpful tool for hands on ministry and a solid theological education for the untrained.
Teaching or preaching on Ezekiel can get tough but Feinberg provides a fine interpretation of the text from a Premillennial Dispensational and Conservative viewpoint. Feinberg believes God is not through with Israel but has future plans for his chosen nation (yet personal salvation is only available through Jesus Christ).<br /><br />The book is highly intepretative seeking out the original intent and meaning of the text. Feinberg often lists options of interpretation (from a conservative viewpoint) and then concludes which view seems the best.<br /><br />Although it is anything but dumbed-down this is an understandable work not bogged down with numerous (unncessary) references to the Hebrew; Hebrew words that are significant are sometimes briefly expounded.  This is 293 pages of meaningful interpretation no fluff nor tedious technicalities. Feingberg does sometimes include a brief but meaningful application of the text.<br /><br />This work is invaluable to pastor professor or serious layman alike. Ezekiel can get thick but Feinberg is a great freind to take along on the journey! By far the best!
Authors Cafi Cohen and Patrick Farenga have addressed the \\"getting into college\\" questions raised by parents schooling their older children at home like \\"How do we work up a set of transcripts?\\" \\"How do we get them into college without a recognized degree?\\" and \\"What choices in education do we have?\\"<br />The sub-title of the book might be misleading. Although a portion of the book talks about getting a child into the \\"best\\" universities and colleges this book will be helpful to homeschoolers concerned about getting their children into any (or not necessarily the best) college.<br />We purchased the book several years ago and have followed its procedure.  We had no trouble getting our daughter enrolled in college.  The book provides clearcut and specific direction that alleviates the fears many of us home-schooling parents experience as we begin the high school years. It is helpful even if your children are not the frequent \\"home schooled genius types.\\"<br />Since working up a transcript is best done on a year by year basis the best time for parents to read this book is probably just before they homeschool their (first) child in the 9th grade.<br />The information on transcripts is worth the purchase price of the book itself.<br />I especially appreciated the authors' description of getting into local colleges through the \\"side door\\" approach by home-schooled teens taking a college course or two during the high school years.<br />Mentioned but not detailed in the book there are colleges that are especially predisposed to homeschooled students.  Many evangelical Christian colleges would be included in that number.<br />The book will not only create confidence in parents it will also provide answers to all those nagging questions that friends or family might ask as demonstrated by the title \\"And What About College.\\"
We used to read this book to our children and they always loved it.  It was especially well received by our son though our daughter enjoyed it too.  The pictures and poetry are about all sorts of slimy things.  One of my favorite pages shows a hardboiled egg flying out of a man's mouth \\"People with no teeth it is said can't eat a slimy pickled egg.\\"<br />This book is pure fun perhaps bordering on the slightly gross (which is why boys especially will go for this one).  Great to read aloud to children 5 and up and can be read by a third  grader I would guess.
Bullinger's massive classifications of figures of speech used in the Bible provides a wealth of help in interpretation.  When I am studying a difficult verse I often use the Scripture index in Bullinger's work to find out if figurative language might come into play.  Not only does Bullinger address figures that we commonly think of (exaggeration/hyperbole etc.) but he divides them into subcategories -- and includes classifications of figures one would not ordinarily detect through a casual reading of Biblical texts.<br /><br />This is not meant for reading or even studying through (though it is fascinating to thumb through it) but is more or less a very useful reference work.  I would label it as an essential book for pastors and Bible teachers.<br /><br />As an evangelical pastor of 24 years I give this book two thumbs up.
I do not always agree with D.A. Carson (although I mostly do) but I always admire and appreciate him.  He is a true scholar who tempers his great mind with a heart for God.<br /><br />Dr. Carson has written a masterpiece!  This volume is an intelligent and definitive grappling with a passage that focuses upon spiritual gifts: I Corinthians 12-14.<br /><br />He devastates the non-charismatic viewpoint that claims the Bible teaches that tongues would end of themselves upon the completion of the New Testament canon or at the end of the apostolic age.  He fortifies (unintentionally) the view of non-charismatics who say \\"God can give the gift of tongues today.  But we do not see the real thing so He must not be doing that right now.\\"  Although he strains to conclude otherwise this is where his evidence could easily lead.  His actual conclusion is that the gift of tongues is being given today but not meant for all and not intended to be the believer's focus.<br /><br />Carson likewise corrects common charismatic abuses by proving the following: (1) every true believer has been baptized in the Spirit (2) there is no one gift possessed by every believer but we should seek prophecy over tongues (3) it is not God's will for all believers to be healed but God can and does heal miraculously as He pleases.<br /><br />Carson's exegesis is reasonable respectful well-informed scholarly to the nth degree clearly delineated and thoroughly documented.  Although he addresses the entire text he particularly focuses upon two of the most controversial spiritual gifts: tongues and prophecy.  His views regarding prophecy are about the same as Wayne Grudem's: New Testament prophets do not bear the authority of Old Testament prophets (rather New Testament authority is vested in the Apostles).  Prophecy is God bringing something to mind and the prophet may mix his own thoughts and thus muddy the prophecy.  Unlike OT prophets who were labeled as true of false in the NT individual prophecies are to be weighed.  There is much to commend this view.<br /><br />His work on tongues is more exhaustive (but still not complete-see my list of unanswered questions below).  He points out that repeated evaluation by linguists have shown that tongues are not human languages.  He argues that some legitimate tongues may be coded languages or patterns (for example a language with its vowels omitted).  This is somewhat questionable though possible (since apparently there has never been a study conducted by expert code-breakers).<br /><br />What is most fascinating is his conclusion that no verifiable correct interpretations of tongues have been made.  Although thorough tests have not been done Carson mentions a friend who recorded a recitation of a passage in Greek and presented the tape to two individuals claiming the gift of interpretation. They presented interpretations that differed from one another and had nothing to do with the text.  He writes \\"I know of no major work that has researched hundreds or thousands of examples; but it could be a very revealing study.\\"<br /><br />But based on this and other similar accounts we might conclude that if God is not (to the best of our knowledge) truly giving the gift of interpretation then tongues are not for use in church meetings (where interpretation is demanded).  In essence tongues at this point are limited to private use and personal edification.<br /><br />Although pensive and thorough Carson has still left a number of unanswered questions including: (1) How do the tongues seen in evangelical charismatic assemblies vary from those seen in Hindu Mormon or Animistic groupings?  (2) Can every human being saved or not speak in ecstatic utterances?  If so is this the basis for Biblical tongues (since lost people can often teach and yet we find a New Testament gift of teaching etc.)?  (3) If Christian tongues were not qualitatively different from tongues-speakers in non-Christian religions then are they really miraculous? (4) Should we allow people to speak in tongues if interpreted even though the evidence we do have seems to indicate that the gift of interpretation may not exist in our time or in our country?  (5) What about the possibility that some of these gifts are distributed more where the Gospel is being established (as opposed to where the church has been embedded)?  Is there evidence to commend or reject this theory?  Is it possible that the reportedly high level of miracles in Indonesia is an example of this?<br /><br />This book is not written at a popular level but challenges the mind. Pastors and theologians will find it stimulating (and it really is not difficult to understand) but its style vocabulary evaluations and refutations may be a stretch for the dedicated laymen.<br /><br />I love books like this!n are they really miraculous?

The Pleasures of God is by far one of the great books of our generation.  John Piper is not only a clear and easy to follow theologian he has a zeal and enthusiasm for the Person of God that is contagious.<br /><br />The genre of this book is hard to peg.  Its theology runs deep - very deep yet it is at the same time devotional; it stretches the intellect but cuts straight to the heart.  Piper's style is truly unique.  His convictions are unashamedly Biblical.<br /><br />The essence of the book may be condensed down to this: God does just as He pleases.  Yet this thesis opens a universe of implications and questions some of which Piper addresses in the book's ten chapters.  They are titled \\"The Pleasure of God in His Son The Pleasure of God in All He Does The Pleasure of God in His Creation The Pleasure of God in His Fame The Pleasure of God in Election The Pleasure of God in Bruising the Son The Pleasure of God in Doing Good to All Who Hope in Him The Pleasure of God in the Prayers of the Upright The Pleasure of God in Personal Obedience and Public Justice and The Pleasure of God in Concealing Himself from the Wise and Revealing Himself to Infants.\\"<br />The Appendix \\"Are There Two Wills in God? Divine Election and God's Desire for All to Be Saved\\" is also worth reading and should be considered an eleventh chapter.<br /><br />Piper's God is the Sovereign God of the Bible.  Although we can only understand what He has revealed He makes no apology for being God nor for His nature; instead He glories in Who He is.  Because the believer is in union with Him through Christ we are included in the great love felt between the Persons of the Trinity.<br /><br />Piper takes the reader through numerous theological and daily issues like election why a good God would allow evil foreign missions prayer the holiness of God the Sovereignty of God the purpose of Christ's atonement - and a whole lot more.<br /><br />I found that this book stretched not only my mind but my soul.  World Magazine rightly included this volume on its list of the top 100 books of the Twentieth Century.  It will take you a while to journey through these 340 thoughtful pages but it will be a journey you will long remember.this volume on its list of the top 100 books of the Twentieth Century.

Wayne Grudem is a scholar and his approach to the New Testament gift of prophecy is refreshing in that he appeals to the thinking Christian.<br /><br />Grudem correlates the Old Testament prophet to the New Testament Apostle while arguing that the New Testament gift of prophecy is not infallible verbally inspired speech; it is simply God bringing a thought to the mind of a believer.  Grudem's argument here is pretty strong if incomplete I think.<br /><br />On the other hand he quotes many Charismatic authors (in a positive light mostly) who state that the flesh affects almost all prophecy.  Although prophecies need not deal with predicting the future those prophecies which do attempt to predict the future according to the charismatic source quoted are wrong about 80% of the time.  If we (and Grudem does not do this)project the same rate of return for non-futuristic prophecy what we end up with is perhaps 20% of all prophecies being acutally true.  If 20% of verifiable prophecies are true then we should logically project that number to non-verifiable prophecies.<br /><br />Prophecy then is God (perhaps) bringing something to the mind of a believer -- about 20% of the time believers sense a prophecy.  Of course our sinful natures may corrupt even some genuine prophecies and no prophet is infallible.  His/her prophecies must each be evaluated not necessarily by church leaders but by individual Christians (so there is no official word as to what we should bank on except if heresy is involved and the elders must step in).  And this gift with all this uncertainty and potential falliblity attached is supposed to edify the church.<br /><br />Incredible as this seems Grudem does make a good argument for the above (although he does not correlate the 80% of future-oriented prophcies with non-future).  Some of his points seem valid espeically his distinction between the Old Testament gift and the New between God bringing something to mind in a general way (while the prophet uses his own words to express what he senses) and inspired speech.<br /><br />Perhaps a better position would be that some of the early church prophets were somewhat closer in authority to Old Testament prophets and did in fact prophesy with \\"Thus says the Lord\\" but that others (the majority) were given a thought regarding what God was doing or wanted done (God bringing something to mind an experience many Christians with various stances on spiritual gifts have sensed). Perhaps that first initial aspect of the gift is no longer with us (and thus no new infallible revelation) while the second form (God bringing something to mind)is.  Of course this seems to be the case with the Apostles (specially empowered founders of the church) in contrast to modern missionaries (apostes in the sense of sent ones) who are sent to regions beyond but do not bear the authority of the founding apostles.<br /><br />Whether Grudem's conclusions are correct in totality in partiality (my view) or not at all this is the type of work we need to read for intelligent study of these difficult and divisive issues. A nice break from mindless assertions or studies with pre-existing agendas. We need to be open to the Scriptures but must avoid playing spiritual \\"pretend\\" games.<br /><br />I recommend this work to parties on all sides of the issue.express what he senses) and inspired speech.

The strength of \\"They Smell Like Sheep\\" is the general direction of the book.  Dr. Lynn Anderson's theme is that elders should focus upon knowing loving serving and nurturing a number of Christians (first and foremost) rather than attending endless board meetings. Although Andersons' arguments are compelling he leaves us with a number of unanswered questions including: \\"Who will make the decisions necessary for a church to advance?\\"  Anderson is right to encourage elders not to get wrapped up in micromanaging or getting out of their domain thus freeing up boards to focus upon more if not completely hands-on ministry.<br />Anderson divides his book into two main sections: \\"A Biblical Look at Spiritual Leadership Principles (The Sort of Things Leaders Do)\\" and \\"A Biblical Look at Elders (The Sort of People They Are).\\"<br />The first section of the book is the strongest and presents church leaders (particularly elders) as Shepherds Mentors and Equippers.  He is to be commended for advocating leadership based upon relationship and earned influence not a chain of command emphasis.  Although much of this material can be found elsewhere Anderson makes this material palatable to the average layman especially those who have never been taught principles of spiritual leadership (as opposed to corporate leadership).  This section is a great primer for elders and other church leaders and worth the price of the book.<br />The second section is weaker.  The author addresses some of the texts regarding the qualification of elders but does so in an unsatisfying way leaving a mountain of unanswered questions.  For example he assumes that the word \\"elder\\" must mean an older man but words change meaning and he does not even acknowledge the existence of diversity among evangelical opinion (for example Timothy oversaw the elders and appointed them even though he was a mere 30 or 35 years old).  Anderson does not demonstrate a serious grappling with the meaning of the text.<br />If the book is weak in particulars the overall strength is its broad themes.  His final few chapters address the meaning of authority and the words used to express this authority in the New Testament.<br />Although his attempt to prove elders should not pull rank through retranslating the Greek words is suspect his point is well taken.  Elders should not pull rank and play the authority game -- not because the Greek words have been mistranslated all these centuries -- but because I Peter 5:1-4 tells us not to do so.  So Anderson gets us to the right point yet not because of his exegesis but in spite of it.  His argument of leading through moral suasion is right on target!  This is an absolutely key thought.<br />As a primer book for getting the feel of the right attitude toward serving as an elder this book is great.  But if you are looking for a scholarly book that addresses all the issues and evaluates a number of interpretations you might be disappointed.

&quot;What Do I Say Next&quot; is a book filled with practical tips for improving conversational skills.  Although the book is not really designed for the super introvert it will help typically shy folks to become better conversationalists.  It also provides much needed direction for the outgoing but rude.  Perhaps the best word to describe Susan Roane's approach is &quot;balanced.&quot;<br />Unlike some books about conversation which are highly manipulative this book is designed for both business and social conversation.  Its direction is useful for almost any situation.<br />The book is written casually.  Although it is not disorganized its casual manner with numerous case studies (these are great stories illustrating specific points) means you can pick up a paragraph here or there and find a complete thought.<br />Much of the material in this volume sounds like common sense.  After many of Roane's suggestions readers might think  &quot;Of course. That's obvious. Why didn't I already know that?&quot;  She offers practical down to earth and realistic advice.<br />The author reinforces her main points with a helpful synopsis after each chapter.  For shy people she encourages them with studies that show 75 per cent of good conversationalists consider themselves shy.  Her solution: use the &quot;OAR&quot; approach (Offer an observation Ask a question and Reveal your thoughts ideas or opinions).  But do not drive people crazy with a barrage of questions she warns us.<br />It is this kind of sensibility and balance that makes this a useful book.  It is a practical self-improvement book not a detailed analysis.  Good conversationalists will find a useful pointer or two weak conversationalists will be overwhelmed with a wealth of advice (and will struggle as to what to do first).  Although I did not agree with the author on every point I recommend this book heartily.
My wife and I appreciated this volume just a few years after it was originally released (our first child was born in 1985). It offers sound medical and relational advice from a Christian perspective and answered many of our questions.<br />We especially appreciated the early sectionsincluding &quot;nurturing a newborn child&quot; and &quot;treating a sick child&quot; (with about 120 page &quot;problem solver&quot;).  This book is helpful for the first time parent.<br />Although we had no problem with the latter part of the book on child-rearing the truly unique sections are the ones mentioned.<br />This would make a great gift for an expecting mother!
As a minister I often use this work to write embellished obituaries highlighting the main evnets in a persons life when I conduct a funeral(e.g. &quot;...when John Smith was born in 1914 Woodrow Wilson signed into law...while Al Jolson's new hit &quot;You Made Me Love You&quot; topped the charts...&quot;)<br />This volume can be useful to writers seeking to set a tone historians or those interested in popular culture or gaining a perspective of America's changing times.<br />It is definitely a reference book interesting to thumb through but not a book for standard reading.
\\"The Revenge of Conscience\\" is a well written thoroughly reasoned approach to conscience (and its relation to politics) from a somewhat unique (but conservative) theological position (a position that is neither quite typically evangelical nor quite typically catholic).<br />Budziszewski is obviously brilliant and his reasoning solid.  He defines conscience based upon Paul's description in the book of Romans about gentiles evidencing the \\"law of God written upon their hearts.\\"  He argues that evil is merely the spoiling of the good and that our God-given conscience when distorted may actually reinforce evil instead of restraining it.  He exposes the inconsistencies of today's pop value systems and devastates them with pure logic.  Ouch!<br />The reader begins to understand the way those who reject Judeo-Christian values reason.  At the heart of this distortion is our fallen condition which suppresses the \\"law of God written upon our hearts.\\"  He refutes the typical Roman Catholic distortion that seems to ignore the suppression of conscience and minimizes the effects of the fall upon human nature; he then contests the opposite imbalance typically held by the reformed position namely a de-emphasis upon \\"the law is written upon the hearts\\" of even the unregenerate.<br />He addresses the distinction between the church's expectations of fellow believers and the church's expectation of society at large.  This then leads Budziszewski to expose the erroneous paradigms proposed by political liberalism and political conservatism.  This guy knows how to think and it is tough to fault his logic.<br />This is a thought-provoking deep book that requires readers to think.  But it is a stimulating book well worth the reading.  Brilliant.
This book might be useful to touchy-feely groups or those who merely skim the surface of Scripture. There is little here for the indepth Bible-oriented preacher.<br />Although object lessons can be useful in holding attention or making points the material here involves volunteers coming forward for this or a brief skit on that.  This is for the attention deficit crowd.<br />I would suggest the object lesson series published by Baker such as \\"Simple Object Lessons for Children.\\"  These make simple and brief points and keep the sermon interesting without turning it into a game show.
John Piper is hard NOT to respect.  He is among a handful of solid theologians who makes the effort to address the challenges to the evangelical faith (from within) with grace clarity and sincerity.<br /><br />In this work Piper defends the traditional evangelical understanding of imputed righteousness i.e. that when a person trusts Christ he not only has his sins forgiven but is on the positive side given the righteousness of Christ.  This concept imputed righteousness is currently being challenged from within evangelicalism.<br /><br />Piper quotes the leading proponent of this view Dr. Robert Gundry explains Gundry's perspective and contrasts it to the traditional one.  He then explores the relevant Scriptures and demonstrates why Gundry is wrong.  He attempts to lead the reader to conclude that the Scriptures do in fact teach that we are counted as righteous once we are in Christ. We exchange our sin for His righteousness.<br /><br />Piper is not really much of a salesman.  Although his language is clear and his sincerity obvious it is the strength of the Scriptures themselves that do the convincing.  And that is not bad!  I highly recommend this work. The serious laymen can understand this volume but it is not \\"pop Christian\\" by any means but requires the reader to think.  And that's not bad either!<br /><br />As we see more and more challenges either directly toward the heart of the Gospel or the periphery it is great to have Piper on our side!  Here is my favorite quotation from this brief volume.  The argument is that if Paul had taught Gundry's view in Romans 1-5 the questions of chapter 6 would never have arisen (this is more formidable than meets the eye; if our version of the Gospel does not result in these questions we may be preaching the wrong message!):<br /><br />\\"The doctrine of justification by faith apart from works raises the question 'Are we to continue in sin that grace may increase?...And shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace?' The raising of these questions is a powerful indication that justification does not include liberation from the mastery of sin.  For if it did these questions would not plausibly arrive...\\"  Good stuff!estions is a powerful indication that justification does not include liberation from the mastery of sin.  For if it did these questions would not plausibly arrive...\\"  Good stuff!
As an evangelical pastor for nearly 25 years I have often turned to Lenski for help when all other commentators fail me.  Although I sometimes disagree with his interpretations he evades nothing but addresses the text in its entirety.<br /><br />Lenski writes from a conservative (which I appreciate) and Lutheran (which I tolerate) perspective (I am not into infant sprinkling or the Lutheran view of Communion).  He regards the Scripture as the Word of God something I greatly appreciate.<br /><br />He is very much the scholar but yet easy to follow.  Although he frequently refers to Greek words or terms Bible students without a Greek background will still value these books.  Bible-believing pastors have relied upon his volumes for many decades but do not let that scare you: he writes in modern efficient (and to the point) English.<br /><br />I would recommend purchasing the entire set.  If you buy them one volume at a time however I would suggest you avoid Revelation unless you hold to an Amillennial perspective.  I especially appreciate his help on the Gospels.  In my view a good study Bible concordance Bible encyclopedia and Lenski's set are a must for every minister or serious student of the Word.
Still Bored in a Culture of Entertainment discusses the rise of boredom in modern culture from a Christian perspective.  Winter a Psychiatrist and theology professor at Covenant Seminary (in St. Louis) looks at the subject of boredom from various angles.<br /><br />He discusses the two main types of boredom (short term and the more permanent type) analyzes trends in modern culture that nurture boredom (over stimulation and constant entertainment) and how personality types make one more or less prone to boredom.  He also documents how boredom has been viewed over the ages.<br /><br />Winter analyzes how post-modern philosophy contributes toward indifference and meaninglessness how boredom encourages addictive behavior or risk taking and then offers a battle plan for the Christian to tackle boredom through six steps (remember the big picture delight in the simple and ordinary cultivate wonder develop strong interests actively engage instead of passively expecting others to initiate).<br /><br />Some quotables include:  \\"Boredom is a subtle form of negative thinking...\\" \\"...to the contemporary mind goodness and beauty often seem boring and unstimulating...\\" and \\"experience and intuition are supported by research that has found links between boredom and all sorts of negative states of mind and behavior...\\"<br /><br />Much of the material in this book can be expanded upon by reading these three volumes \\"Bowling Alone\\" \\"Natural Prozac\\" and  \\"The Overspent American.\\"  I think this is a fine book though a bit boring at times (sorry but it is true!).  Good stuff nonetheless.
I write as a natural talker (but as a minister I try to help others who are weak here hence my research) who has no trouble with small talk and Carducci's booklet is indeed a summary of how we talkers do indeed initiate small talk.<br />Keep this in mind: this booklet(and it is smallabout 77 half pages)zeros in on small talk not the details of indepth conversation developing friendship or overcoming shyness. Carducci provides sample conversations to show how not to do it and then offers the positive alternative approach.The author outlines key concepts and so that you can get a handle on them.<br />He could emphasize body language more than he does yet he does touch on it. So if you are wanting to improve your small talking skills this is a quick summary of how to do just that.
Pentecost is a true scholar and a good Bible-believing teacher of the Word. This volume is theologically dependable.  He is Premillennial dispensational and a good interpreter by my standards.<br /><br />On the negative side it is horribly written with constant and relentless quoting of 19th century scholars.  Because of this it contains the horrid and ambiguous Victorian era verbiage (how those people loved to make the simple complicated!) and plagued by the small font of lenghty quotations.  He is constantly quoting Edersheim or Geikie.  I already have Edersheim and Geikie. I was hoping Pentecost would deliver me from the Victorian era and present a freshly written work in a latter 20th Century straight-forward American style.<br /><br />As a result I use this volume only as a last resort.
I am a pastor who has a gift of gab and a number of friends some of them close.  My sister (who is the ultimate friendly person) and I were raised by parents who knew how to converse well so we picked up these skills in a natural setting.  We are both real schmoozers.  My wife is also highly relational.  So unlike many self-help book reviewers I am reviewing from a different perspective: I did not read this book for personal growth reasons (I do read books on other subjects to address my weak spots however) but to try to help instruct others who struggle here.<br />For many years I have dealt with folks who wanted to learn to converse and make friends.  When one is brought up with those skills it becomes difficult to enumerate exactly what it is we talkers do.  When I read &quot;How to Start a Conversation and Make Friends&quot; I said to myself &quot;Yep.  This is a lot of what we (and many other people strong in this area) do.&quot;  Gabor has organized and put into outline form the most basic principles of conversation and friendship initiation.  And that is a whole lot more helpful than saying &quot;I don't know.  We just do it!&quot;<br />Gabor also allows for differing personalities and relational styles.  Although we may have to leave our comfort zone (in time change becomes comfortable) we need to be who we are and converse with others based upon who they are.<br />Please understand that this book is limited in its scope.  It can help people initiate friendships but it does not direct one toward relational depth.  This book can help folks make a number of casual friends but not necessarily close friends.  For deeper communication I suggest William Backus' book &quot;Telling Each Other the Truth&quot; a volume that addresses matters like conflict resolution honesty etc.  Gabor's book is not really intended to guide you into relational depth.  It does a great job for its intent: helping you chat better and initiate the early stages of friendship.  For some folks their instincts may kick in at that point.  Others will need to study further.<br />The other limitation of this book (and there is no way to avoid it) is that the directives can be overwhelming because of their sheer volume.  My advice is to choose a few areas to work on.  Once those practices are incorporated and become second nature then it is time to add a few more.  In a sense the book is arranged in order of importance with the early chapters being the most crucial to master.  I recommend starting at the beginning.<br />In addition to Gabor's insights I suggest hanging around and imitating those who seem to have it together in these departments.  There is nothing quite like seeing conversation in action and then telling oneself to &quot;go and do likewise.&quot; It may seem awkward at first but in time it can become second nature.  Some folks (who have difficulty choosing the right words) might even consider practicing a conversation in an empty room almost memorizing a script.<br />On quotable section reads &quot;Most shy people take the passive role when it comes to starting conversation.  They wait and wait and wait hoping someone will come along and start a conversation with them...&quot;<br />He emphasizes that communication consists mostly of body language then tone or voice and lastly words.<br />Here is some simplistic but crucial advice &quot;Use plenty of eye contact smile and above all keep your arms uncrossed and your hands away from your face.&quot;<br />The book consists of 15 chapters divided into 4 sections.  The sections are: Starting Your Conversation with Confidence. Continuing Your Conversation with Wit and Charm Ending Your Conversation with a Great Impression and Boosting Your Conversation to the Next Level.<br />The last chapter lists his 50 main points some of which include &quot;Be the first to say hello Introduce yourself to others Show others you are listening by restating their comments and Beware of open and closed body language.&quot;<br />This book is not rocket science (though filled with details) but it is a good place to start.  Although I consider myself strong in the conversation department I admit that I did pick up a pointer or two.  Go for it.ts and Beware of open and closed body language.&quot;<br />This book is not rocket science (though filled with details) but it is a good place to start.  Although I consider myself strong in the conversation department I admit that I did pick up a pointer or two.  Go for it.
Practical Insights into the Mechanics of Conflict January 6 2003<br />I read this book nearly 10 years ago and found it very helpful. As a pastor of over 23 years and a survivor of a few humdinger conflicts it was comforting to know that conflicts have patterns. It also helped me control my own responses.<br />I wouldn't wish church conflicts on a dog but they seem to come (to most of us in the ministry not dogs!) no matter what precautions we take. But they can often be contained early and this book can help. It will also help you accept that conflict is common and to be expected therefore leading us to the conclusion that one should be as prepared as possible. The chapters are all pretty good but those written by Speed Leas excel.<br />The time to read this book is before (or early on)conflict begins. Every pastor needs to be prepared for what is inevitable. Lay leaders (board members etc.) can also benefit from this book. Also helpful would be Terry Muck's book &quot;When to Take A Risk.&quot;
Though the book is titled &quot;Spiritual Mentoring of Teens&quot; that specific subject is only a small portion of this volume's material.  It is really a thorough positive book about rearing teens including matters like communication choosing what to fight over and what to let slide practical do's and don'ts tons of relational stuff--a wealth of good realistic advice for parents who want to encourage their children toward godliness without creating a backlash through over-control.<br />The front cover of the book identifies it with James Dobson's &quot;Focus on the Family&quot; and it is in line with Focus on the Family's general philosophy.  This would make a great textbook for a class and wonderful reading for serious parents.<br />As with any book of this nature there is bound to be a point or two readers will disagree with.  For me it was the author's advice to assure that teens are in a church with &quot;lively worship.&quot;  Sounds like a theological bias toward charismatic/seeker sensitive approach to me.  There is a lot to be said (but is usually unsaid) about the importance of building stability and convictions beyond the superficial and entertaining.  Teaching children that church is about things like relationships growth in grace and knowledge and faithfulness (rather than being entertained) has gone the way of the record player.<br />Despite my personal soapbox I highly recommend this volume as one of the better ones available.
Although this work is old it is in many ways still up to date.<br />It brings together Scriptures that apparently contradict one another and shows how they can be reconciled.<br />These discrepancies are resolved hermenutically (interpretationally) not so much archaeologically.  Therefore most resolutions do not depend upon discoveries made in the 125 years since the book was originally authored.  One could probably find similiar reconciliations by digging through commentaries but we often want a quick and ready answer and Haley often comes through. His answers are brief and understandable--no fluff. Although not all of his reconciliations are satsifying most are.<br />This is a reference book not a book for reading.  But it sure comes in handy.  Gleason Archer's book &quot;Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties&quot; is much more thorough about the subjects it covers (and I highly recommend it) but it only address a fraction of the passages addressed here by Haley.<br />Along with Bullinger's &quot;Figures of Speech Used in the Bible&quot; both of these 19th century volumes have no worthy modern replacements.
This is a great set.  I got it about 20 years ago when it first came out and as a pastor of over 23 years I say \\"Go for it!\\"  Although I do not refer to this work every week it comes in handy when I need to do a Hebrew word study. Because it is cross-indexed with Strongs you can find the Hebrew words (and their definitions/expansions) without knowing a stitch of Hebrew.<br /><br />For practical ministry use this is the set to get!  It provides plenty of information clear definitions but does not get tedious (usually). I would recommend it over older studies which are not nearly as accurate (especially those done before the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in the 1940's).
The author lived in the 17th century and began a noble task: relating the teachings of the New Testament to its Jewish roots.<br />Unfortunately he died before he completed his task so this work only addresses the four Gospels and then the brief fourth volume offers a few comments on passages from Acts to I Corinthians (but this last volume is half the size of the others).  It is tragic that he was not able to finish this work and to my knowledge no one ever has.<br /><br />It is helpful for the pastor or serious Christian who is into the Jewish backgrounds of the New Testament.  Although my first reference in this regard is the recent \\"Jewish New Testament Commentary\\" (Stern) Lightfoot's work brings many Talmudic passages into the picture to add insight.  They are liberally quoted and referenced.<br /><br />The author has a reverence and respect for Scripture as the Word of God.  Although the English style is old it is understandable.<br />If you are into the Jewish roots and backgrounds of the Christian faith and you are a teacher of the Word I highly recommend this.  Others might be wise to borrow a copy first and see if it is for them.
If you can get a copy of this book please do so!  Rausch clearly and simply explains Judaism by focusing on three topics:  Judaism The People of Judaism and Groups and Relationships.<br /><br />He explains Biblical and extra-biblical Jewish ways and customs (yearly and life cycles) dispels myths (e.g. Jews are usually wealthy concerned only about their own people etc.) explains how modern Judaism got where it is (historical survey) and then discusses the modern divisions of Judaism (Orthodox Conservative and Reform among others).<br /><br />Although this book looks at Judaism from an evangelical perspective the book does not focus so much on evangelism as it does upon understanding (though it does not deny the call we have to evangelize).<br /><br />This book is a great survey written for the common man and includes a fine glossary of terms at the end of the book.  It accomplishes what it attempts helping us to \\"understand Jews and Judaism.\\"  You will finish the book with a new understanding and love for your Jewish friends. Probably the best book of its type.  I highly recommend it.
I always appreciate Barna's fine research though I sometimes disagree with his conclusions and suggested responses to data.  But Barna not only provides us with a wealth of information about modern teens he offers solid direction for church leaders or parents as well.<br />Today's teens are generally more positive and cheerful than teens were just 3 or 4 years ago.  In many ways they are a breath of fresh air when compared to the past two generations.<br />On the other hand today's youth think less logically and more emotionally than previous generations.  Using the \\"four personality type grid\\" Barna reveals that 45% of todays teens are Influencers (Sanguines) compared to 30% of the adult population.  This section alone is worth the price of the book.<br />Barna tells all: their spiritual beliefs their mode of thinking and their views of church.  After a thorough analysis of all the data he urges church leaders and youth groups to concentrate more on ministry to teens and less on marketting (real ministry as opposed to merely drawing large numbers through entertainment).<br />The seven chapters are titled Lifestyles and Influences What They're Thinking and Feeling Matters of the Heart Inside the Heads of Teens White/Black/Hispanic Faith and Spirituality and Challenges on the Road Less Traveled.<br />Anyone who is concerned about youth ministry (youth pastors sponsors senior pastors board members teachers parents of teens etc.)simply must read this one!
Prayer books that are in tune with Scripture and address life's troubled times are a rare entity.  This one is a gem.  They are written from a solidly evangelical/fundamental perspective in common English.<br />The length of each prayer varies from one-half to one whole page.<br />They are not filled with fluff or flowery language but state the need and express trust in God to help with the need.<br />The nearly 200 prayers are divided into 3 sections: Praying for Myself Praying for Others and Praying Together.  Subjects for prayer are diverse including A New Parent's Prayer Prayer for Fear of Flying Help Me Find A Job When A Wife Dies Prayer for A Foster Parent Prayer As An Ambulance Passes Prayer for An Unsaved Friend Help With A Difficult Roommate A Prayer for Headache Sufferers A Prayer for People Dragged into Court and about 180 others.<br />Biblical doctrinally solid sensitive but not highly emotional--<br />-this is a tremendous prayer book.  Although Jeannie St. John Taylor edited the work over 25 individuals contributed prayers.<br />Top notch.  Go for it!
This is ideal material to use for either one on one discipleship (training) or for a small group. The material is simple and clear to understand but requires committment of all involved.<br />There are verses to memorize (only 5 over a ten week period) and Bible studies to complete.  The program helps to establish regular Bible reading and a daily quiet time.<br />This material tackles the biggest issues of the Christian life like assurance of salvation Bible study resisting temptation  prayer witnessing and fellowship.<br />This material should not be confused with a follow up course that teaches a few basics but is for the believer who is wanting to seriously follow Jesus Christ.  It is good stuff!<br />As a pastor of 23 years it is what I use.
Randy Frazee gives us something to think about in this work.  His diagnosis is solid: many people do not connect within the church and attempts to connect are often \\"contrived and forced...\\";  these words \\"contrived and forced\\" are in a sense the heart of the book's agenda.  Frazee wants to replace contrived attempts with genuine connectedness and for that he is to be respected.<br />How can people learn to be social creatures again?  Our society has lost its ability to connect socially and many look to the church to provide the answer.  When people do look they are often disappointed.<br />Frazee shows how modern behavior patterns and mindsets sabotage the possibility of building deep relationships.  His book is divided into three sections.  The first \\"Connecting to A Common Purpose\\" explores the problem of individualism and how discovering and agreeing upon Biblical purpose can (theroretically) address it. He offers practical suggestions like limiting kids to only one sport etc. so that families have time to get together with other families.  The second section \\"Connecting to A Common Place\\" talks about the need for stability: staying put in a church in a job and in a neighborhood.  The third section \\"Connecting to Common Possessions\\" is a very moderate approach toward helping and sharing with one another. Do not be afraid of this section: it is balanced and reasonable.<br />There are many quotables in this book.  Here is my favorite from page 142 \\"Most pastors have come to realize that they can plan for new members to be a part of the church for only two to five years before these members move again.  So prevalent is this mobility phenomenon that most people assume a new relationship isn't going to last long before one or the other of them (or both) moves away--so why bother getting started in the first place the thinking goes.\\"<br />Although I shouted a few \\"Amens\\" while reading this work I disagree with Frazee's solution.  The problem with this volume-- and others like it-- is that people who follow such approaches do not get comfortable with their humanity and that of others.  Or to put it another way engineering relationships does not work.  Even Frazee's program if followed by people with this common \\"connecting deficit\\" defect will still be contrived.<br />People who are social and value relationships will tend to stay put and build life-long friendships. The others can rarely be convinced. There is something dysfunctional about a person who cannot connect:  the problem is not usually lack of structure.  Though perhaps the majority of modern Americans do not connect well the first step is to face the reality that they have the defect.<br />Tense people who long to connect often defeat connecting by their tense desire to do so.  Connecting people are at ease with and enjoy people. And until a person is at ease with humanity and imperfection he cannot be a connector. For example one of Frazee's suggested social activity is watching videos together.  People who connect (not because they are part of some contrived program) enjoy people so much they'd probably rather play cards.<br />Additionally better than connecting is becoming a connector.  Since churches generally accept anybody people with poor social skills get away with murder in a church context.  We reward them.<br />If you really want to understand connecting you are better off studying secular groups where people connect because they have relational depth not because there is an ethic to include anybody and everybody.<br />Books like \\"Bowling Along\\" (Putnam) are most illuminating here. Do you subscribe to and read your daily paper?  Do you make the effort to meet a new neighbor?  Do you watch the news and vote?  Do you belong to clubs or civic organizations? Do you watch only a moderate amount of TV? Do you have people over for a visit at least once a month?  Is your church attendance faithful including dinners and special events?  Do you serve in a ministry?  Odds are those who said \\"yes\\" to most of the above are the real connectors.<br />Frazee is right in this regard: the church should provide opportunities for connection. But connectors will thrive even with few such opportunities and most non-connectors will not genuinely connect no matter what the structure. Non-connectors instead need to realize that they have a defect and learn by imitating connectors how to overcome it.  Opportunities to connect will train future generations and help those who are truly teachable and aware of their connecting deficit.  And for these teachable people Frazee's approach will work--if coupled with a desire to connect socially not only in church but to the community as well.vents?  Do you serve in a ministry?

First of all please note that Amazon is wrong: this book is not authored by John MacArthur.  He merely wrote the preface. Preaching With Passion was written by Alex Montoya. It does not offer a lot of unique material but it clearly presents an explanation of what is required to preach with conviction and sincerity.<br /><br />The book offers more than a few clever complaints about boring and tedious preaching beginning in the first chapter \\"Preach with Spiritual Power.\\"  The other chapters include: \\"Preach with Conviction Preach with Compassion Preach with Authority Peach with Urgency Preach with Brokeness Preach with the Whole Being and Preach with Imagination.<br /><br />For someone who has not been exposed to similar material this work may prove beneficial.  It emphasizes the need for the preacher to have a close walk with God and a burden for his people.  For those of us who have attended pastor's conferences and been around the block a few times its value may be more motivational than informational.
Larsen packs this book with quotables illustrations and assessments of well-known or respected authorities.  Although he drops a lot of names and offers numerous &quot;golden nuggets&quot; the book is not a practical &quot;how to&quot; work nor is it concise and to the point.<br />Larsen inspires and offers a lot of &quot;jabs&quot; scoldings and creative contrasts but if I had not learned how to do narrative exposition elsewhere I would not have learned it here. He would have left me with a lot of information but no clear procedure--or if there is a clear procedure it is buried within quotations excerpts and witicisms.<br />If you want to read this book for enjoyment and inspiration (or pithy sayings) you will not be disappointed. His theological positions are wonderful.  But if you want concrete and to the point procedures you may be let down.
...<br />Harvard professor Juliet Schor has written a timely and convincing work.  Schor's argument is that people are actually happier when they are not obsessed with craving material luxuries.<br />Schor's perspective is balanced realistic and moderate.  Unlike books that offer advice on money management Schor cuts to the quick and goes to the heart of the problem: we buy not because we need but because we attempt to find identity status or security through our purchases.<br />The volume is divided into seven chapters.  The first is titled \\"Introduction\\" but is not really merely an introduction.  It is a chapter in the fullest sense and might better be titled \\"overview.\\"  Let me share one of numerous quotables from this section: \\"American consumers are often not conscious of being motivated by social status and are far more likely to attribute such motives to others than to themselves.  We live with high levels of psychological denial about the connection between our buying habits and the social statements they make.\\"<br />The second chapter \\"Communicating With Commodities\\" discusses how people crave the standard of living portrayed by television sitcoms. The American majority is frustrated (and sometimes desperate to attain such a standard) because they compare themselves to these fictious upper middle classed lifestyles.  Shcor illustrates where this can lead by referring to the \\"sneaker murders\\" where people were actually killed for their shoes (of the \\"proper\\" brand of course).<br />The third chapter \\"The Visible Lifestyle\\" emphasizes the sub-conscious quest for status.  In her typically well-balanced perspective she distinguishes between \\"the desire [for] social status [and]...trying to avoid social humiliation.\\"  This is a GREAT chapter.<br />The fourth chapter \\"When Spending Becomes You\\" is also superb.  She quotes one statistic that 61 per cent of the population ALWAYS has something in mind they look forward to buying.  She also discusses how religion used to curtail obsessive materialism and spending but no longer does.  As a professional clergymen I'll second that.  She is right.<br />The last two chapters \\"The Downshifter Next Door\\" and \\"Learning Diderot's Lesson\\" offer practical ways to attack this problem.  We must change our attitudes and view frugality as a virtue not a vice.  She offers several case studies of \\"downshifters\\" those who have decided that once past a modest financial threshold family time and the deeper things of life are worthy of financial sacrifice.<br />This volume exposes how shallow foolish and silly our society has become in our uncontrollable culture of reckless spending.

Book Review<br />Preparing Your Child for Dating (Dr. Bob Barnes Zondervan 1998;<br />203pp)<br />by Ed Vasicek<br />Preparing Your Child for Dating is an excellent well-rounded volume covering the broad spectrum of dating issues from a mainstream evangelical Christian viewpoint. The author Dr. Bob Barnes operates under the premise that controlled dating under parental supervision prepares one for dating when no longer under that supervision. Courtship (as per Josh Harris) he argues leaves a child naive and unprepared for dating once &quot;out of the nest.&quot;<br />The book is divided into four sections with sections two and three receiving the most space. The divisions are: (1)A Generation with No Guidelines(2)The Plan for Dating(3)The Dating Processand(4)The Lessons Learned.<br />Two chapters were notable in the first section. One of them entitled &quot;Develop a Plan Before You Develop A Problem&quot; urges parents to be proactive in dating. He writes  &quot;Left to their own deviceswith no guidance from parentsteens begin dating with very immature ideas about the opposite sex.....Parents must develop a dating plan for their children...(pp.24-25).&quot;<br />Another chapter titled &quot;Who's in Charge Here?&quot; tells it like it often is: &quot;In many homes the children are in charge of their own dating. Their parents think there's nothing they can do...In Parent-Directed Dating the parents implement a training program that teaches their children about dating but puts the responsibility for proper dating squarely on the shoulders of the child (pp.35-36).&quot;<br />Section two talks about developing a &quot;dating plan.&quot; Since the long-term goal of dating is to find an appropriate person to marry Dr. Barnes suggests developing a list with children before they date as to what they want in a mate. The list is divided into absolute requirements(examples: a dedicated Christianno drugs/alcohol etc.)important but not absolutely necessary qualities and then preferences. When a girl is asked out on a datefor exampleshe goes over that list with a parent. This helps decisions to be more objective and less emotional.  Rather than become emotionally involved and then choosing whether to obey the Lord or rationalize disobediencemisplaced emotions are avoided.<br />When going to a &quot;party&quot; the author argues it is very logical for parents to speak to the host parents. They need to inquire as to whether the parents will be present and what standards will be upheld. Though young people will claim theirs was the  only mom to do such a thing Dr.Barnes says &quot;do it!&quot;<br />Parents must also discuss with their teens what is and is not<br />appropriate. The word &quot;appropriate&quot; he suggests is a key term. What sort of affection(in public and private)is and is not acceptable? What sort of places are and are not appropriate?<br />In the third sectionthe author discusses &quot;The Dating Process.&quot; Ages for double and single dating must be decided beforehand.  The author gives no absolute plan (purposely so)but does mention that his daughter was allowed to double date at age 16 for example. Privileges must be earned(for example a curfew can be extended after a young person has proven himself/herself trustworthy by obeying the previous curfew etc;otherwise the curfew is made even earlier!). Quiet objective firmness can control the argumentive pattern that develops when parents give in.<br /><br />One strong emphasis in this section is the importance of &quot;interviewing&quot; the &quot;date&quot; beforehand (perhaps having the young person over for Sunday dinner). This can &quot;weed out&quot; many problems and is in itself worth the price of the book.<br />The last section &quot;The Lessons Learned&quot; discusses releasing a prepared young person to independence the ultimate goal being self-discipline.<br />As a pastor one of the biggest obstacles I find in rearing young people today is parents whose heads are buried in the sand  assuming things have changed little since they were young (as mentioned above).

Torn Asunder:  Recovering from Extramarital Affairs<br />Written by Dave Carder  (Moody Press rev. 1995)<br />Reviewed by Pastor Ed Vasicek<br />I first heard Dave Carder at the Moody Bible Institute's pastor's conference in 2000.  After attending his workshop about counseling situations involving marital infidelity I returned home and immediately ordered his book.  I was not disappointed.<br />Torn Asunder was written for those somehow connected to marital affairs including prodigal spouses their mates pastors counselors or concerned friends.  It is easy to understand thoroughly evangelical in conviction and based on the author's practical counseling experience and keen observation.  It offers clear direction and principals upon which to build.<br />The book is divided into three main sections.  The first division \\"Understanding Extramarital Affairs\\" contains five chapters which distinguish types of affairs causes and factors that contribute toward improper relationships.  The second subdivision boasts six chapters and is titled \\"Healing from Affairs.\\"  The last three chapters tie up a few miscellaneous loose ends and are sectioned off as  \\"Special Circumstances.\\"<br />The author writes clearly simply and informatively.  He provides only a few necessary statistics (e.g. 50 to 65% of husbands and 45-55% of wives have had extra-marital affairs by the age of 40) as well as some surprising insights:  \\"Young wives today are actually having affairs at a faster rate than same-aged men...\\"<br />Some of Carder's material is questionable.  For example the author describes the types of personalities that are more affair-prone than others without backing up his claims through documented studies.  Most of what he says in this volume however does ring true to reality.<br />Carder offers a lot of meaty information.  A few helpful statements include:  \\"In sporadic longer-lasting affairs the spouse will need about two years to recover...\\" and \\"The only lasting remedy is for the infidel to feel the agony he has caused the spouse.\\"  He does not minimize the pain and anger involved in these traumatic situations.<br />Carder views infidelity as not just indicative of a troubled individual but rather indicative of a troubled marriage relationship involving both partners.  He writes \\"The goal for both to figure out is: what emotional and physical nurturance did the infidel receive from the affair that was unavailable in the marriage?\\"<br />I recommend this book to those struggling with recovery from infidelity pastors counselors people-helpers or anyone interested in a Christian perspective as to the causes prevention and recovery of marital affairs.  It is thorough sensitive clear balanced and faithful to the Scriptures.g remedy is for the infidel to feel the agony he has caused the spouse.\\"  He does not minimize the pain and anger involved in these traumatic situations.<br />Carder views infidelity as not just indicative of a troubled individual but rather indicative of a troubled marriage relationship involving both partners.

\\"The Enduring Paradox\\" is a collection of scholary but clear essays addressing theological and practical questions of interest to Messianic Jews and students of Scripture in general.<br />The essayists include some big guns in the evangelical world including Walter Kaiser and Louis Goldberg as well as  a number of Messianic Judaism's scholars.  The editor John Fisher (and his wife Patrice) contributes the greatest number of essays.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections (1) Messianic Jewish Theology (2) Messianic Jews and Israel and (3) Practical Issues for Messianic Jews and Non-Jews.<br /><br />There is much to be praised in this book.  Patrice Fisher's chart on page 178 distinguishing between native-born Jews Godfearers Foreigners and Pagans is simple but superb in its clarity. Lawrence Rich's chapter on \\"Jewish Practice and Identity in the Book of Acts\\" is worth the purchase price of the book.<br /><br />On the negative side John Fisher's chapter about \\"Covenant Fulfillment and Judaism in Hebrews\\" seems a bit of a stretch.<br />It is important to interpret Scripture without a pre-existing agenda.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone but it is written clearly and it is not lenghty. Most dedicated laymen can grasp it.  Good fodder for thought especially for those who value the Jewish roots of Christianity are serious about Bible interpretation or participate in the Messianic Jewish movement.
\\"The World Jesus Knew\\" has got to be one of the best books of its kind. Five Stars are not enough. The sub-title \\"Beliefs and Customs from the Time of Jesus\\" sounds too mundane for the exciting information found within these pages.<br /><br />The book specializes is showing how Biblical manners customs or culture \\"figure in\\" to events recorded in the Gospels.  For example the type of \\"inn\\" in which Jesus was born was probably a two story rectangular building with a well in the courtyard.  The rooms were upstairs with an animal \\"garage\\" downstairs below each room.  Jesus was probably born in one of these animal shelters.<br /><br />As a seasoned Christian and pastor I picked up many insights from this readable volume. A number of these tidbits can be found elsewhere but much of this information was new to me. \\"The World Jesus Knew\\" is a must for any serious Christian--pastor professor or dedicated laymen--anyone who wants to better understand the Gospels. For another example in northern Israel (where Jesus was raised) women would wear coins given them at marriage--their security---sewed into their head dresses. This sets the tone for understanding the parable of the lost coin.  More was at stake for the woman who lost the coin than just a few meager dollars.<br /><br />This book is filled with gems like this and offers numerous interpretational possibilities most within an evangelical framework. A few interpretations are a bit of the stretch but many ring true. The author nicely references Scripture passages.<br />Although most information provides enlightenment toward understanding the Gospels there are other portions of Scripture brought to light through these cultural insights.  The section on the cultivation of the Olive Tree and how branches were grafted in helps open up that passage in Romans.<br /><br />The chapter titles include: \\"The Home Jesus Entered The Education Jesus Received The Clothes Jesus Wore Cultural Ways Jesus Followed The Temple Jesus Loved The Synagogue Jesus Attended\\" and more.<br /><br />The author writes from a fairly conservative evangelical position and with great respect for the Jewish roots of the Christian faith.  She has obviously thoroughly researced the Talmud and many other traditional writings from ancient Judaism in her attempt to set a cultural context for the Gospels.<br /><br />Although obviously a scholar Punton communicates simply clearly and interestingly.

There are many variations for cooking Czech and Slovak dishes.  This brief flip-chart bookelt has about 100 recipes.  It is weak in the soup department but strong in bakery and main courses.  Included are meat dishes like Chicken Paprika and one version of Marinated Beef (Svckova).<br />Other favorites include liver dumplings nut cake poppy seed pastries and of course Kolacki (Kolaches).  The last section of the book includes the words for the Czech and Slovak anthems and proverbial sayings from the region.  It is not a complete Czech and Slovak cookbook but contains good tried and true recipes.
This volume is a must for anyone truly concerned about World Missions.  Dedicated laymen pastors and others will find this a valuable resource.  It is written from the evangelical perspective.<br />Most nations are summarized in one to three pages.  Summaries include a map description of area peoples and people groups literacy capital city economy politics and of great interest to Christians religious demagraphics.  Christians are separated into sub-categories as well (Roman Catholic Orthodox Protestant--which is further sub-divided into evangelical and charistmatic).<br />Current history special needs/situations and current ministry approaches form yet another category.  Each article provides a list of needs and prayer requests.  The countries are also co-ordinated with a date atop the page for those who wish to pray for a nation a day.<br />As a pastor I find this my most important missions resource.  It is clearly number 1 for missions demagraphics.
Finally something unique in the growing mountain of church growth materials!  \\"Surprising Insights\\" offers a mixture of both old standard \\"church growth\\" concepts and some truly \\"surprising\\" insights that will both encourage and challenge pastors of conviction committed to preaching the Word of God and holding the doctrinal line.<br /><br />The author Thom Rainer (and his research team) have taken a truly unique approach to church growth: rather than survey the unchurched they studied the \\"formerly unchurched\\" the success stories of outreach.  Why did men and women who rarely attended church decide to get involved?  Rainer rightly points out that most unchurched people will never become regular attenders so why study them?  Why not reach the reachable?<br /><br />Rainer pulls out of his bag some treasures old and new.  Maybe 60%f of the concepts he highlights such as \\"pursuing excellence\\" in facilities and children's programs or being \\"purpose driven\\" are already part of church growth dogma.  But the other 40% offers some eye-opening surprises.  This landmark study is not just the same old same old.<br /><br />Amazingly the formerly unchurched were drawn to churches with doctrinal conviction (remarkably folks who transferred from church to church were LESS interested in doctrine or solid teaching than the unchurched).  The majority of the formerly unchurched wanted in-depth (expository) Bible teaching not merely pop-psychology topical sermons.  The churches that reached the unchurched were usually intentionally evangelistic.  They also seemed specialized in attracting women to church (sometimes through good programs for their children); the women were won to Christ and then often their husbands eventually came to faith (if the church was burdened to reach their husbands).  The pastors worked hard at leadership and evangelism but compensated by dropping the ball in counseling hospital visitation servant-like menial tasks and pastoral care in general.<br /><br />Every pastor needs to struggle with how much of a price he is willing to pay to lead his church toward growth.  But even those of us who are unwilling to reduce our levels of pastoral care can adopt many of the philosophies in this book.  I found the book both encouraging and challenging.ith how much of a price he is willing to pay to lead his church toward growth.

From Karl Marx to Tolstoy to Bertrand Russell to Jean-Paul Sarte to Hemmingway Paul Johnson demonstrates the folly of many leading intellectuals.  The proof is in the pudding and reasonable philosophies come from reasonable people.  The problem is amplified because modern society has been absorbing these approaches to life and society that failed the very authors who espoused them.<br />The old saying bears true of many leading intellectuals: &quot;He is so smart he is stupid.&quot;  So many of our leading intellectuals lived anything but functional lives and their philosophies exist to multiply their own person dysfunctionality.  It is about time someone with intellectual sense exposed these men and women for the confused but brilliant people they were.  Like Joe Friday on Dragnet it's about time their own personal lives were reviewed with &quot;Just the facts mam.&quot;<br />Unlike many modern intellectuals Johnson is one of the few who is capable of seeing the big picture.  Philosophy is about life.<br />If the philosophers themselves lived tortured lives perhaps it is time we stopped blindly accepting their decreed wisdom.<br />Those who espouse Judeo-Christian ethics will eat this book up; those who prefer ANYTHING but Judeo-Christian ethics will despise this work. Despite the fact that the author freely interprets the facts are brutally clear.
Good solid hermeneutics and clear presentation make this an ideal volume for the pastor student or serious layperson. MacArthur is not only an excellent Bible teacher but he writes simply for popular use yet nothing is water-down. This is a most thorough work useful in preparing sermons lessons or personal growth. MacArthur interprets from a moderate dispensational viewpoint and seems to follow obejctive principle of interpretation. He brings in a generous amount of cultural and background information as well as other Bible texts. I suggest you purchase the entire Matthew set. There is probably none finer.

The Church on the Other Side is an intelligent but compromising work which offers both keen insights and devastating suggestions.<br />On one hand McLaren encourages us to view church structures and philosophies as fluid; he urges us to accept change as normal and not get obsessed with forms.  He urges us to understand and adapt to the Post-modern world and emerge strongly on &quot;The Other Side.&quot;  The author is clearly quite intelligent.<br />He also emphasizes a call that needs to be heard namely that Christians are not living  Christian lifestyles: adultery/divorce and other behavior that shames the name of Christ is running rampant.  We need to get our houses in order.<br />On the other hand the type of church McLaren advocates is a church not worth surviving in my view.  He tells us we should not evangelize in Catholic areas and de-emphasizes the importance of solid doctrine (excepting the Trinity); he stands against Scientific Creationism but advocates theistic evolution; he advocates faith but not only Bible-oriented evangelical faith but the faith of Christendom at large; in short he betrays the Reformation and seems to deny (by practice) the evangelical conviction that theology and methodology are best derived from &quot;non-agenda&quot; Bible exegesis.<br />McLaren's approach may help maintain the health of Christendom but it will weaken the evangelical church and expedite further movement away from Biblical literacy. Christianity for the sake of Christianity (or for the betterment of society) can never replace a Christianity composed of obedient Christians attempting to discern the will of God from His Word.
This book makes the key figures in American history come to life.  It reads like a novel and is hard to put down.  I had not been a lover of American history until I read Johnson's work. He presents all sides of America's big names and unlike most works presents his opinions AS OPINIONS.<br />You will learn little know facts about America's presidents statesmen philosophers and religious leaders.  The author is moderately conservative a nice change from the party line of the politically correct.  On the other end of the spectrum the ultra-conservative will not aprpreciate Johnson's inclusion of the negative attributes and the sometimes non-religious nature of some American patriots.  It is evident that he attempts to be objective and tries to reach reasonable conclusions.<br />If you can only read one book about American history make it this one.  If you have found American history pale in comparison to European history this volume might change your mind.
Robert Lewis has written a top-notch easy to understand easy to implement book to help Christian dads rear godly masculine sons.<br />He defines a man as &quot;....someone who rejects passivity accepts responsibility leads courageously and expects the greater reward.&quot;  His definition of ideal manhood is excellent especially his emphasis upon &quot;rejecting passivity.&quot;<br />Although he does not always lay out an exact plan for readers to follow without variation he shares his own experiences and ideas as a suggested approach.<br />The book is divided into five parts:  The need for a modern-day knighthood The Knight and his ideals The Knight and his ceremonies the Knight and his round table (community of men) and the Knight and his legacy.  Part two &quot;The Knight and His Ideals&quot; is alone worth the purchase price of the book.  His suggestions for cermonies that celebrate a boy's advancement into manhood are creative.<br />This book helped me come up with some related ideas.  As a result of reading this book I implemented a &quot;Knights of Light&quot; training seminar for our junior high boys (I am a pastor); I compiled info on courtesy respecting women etc. and we had a knighting ceremony for the guys that completed this training.  Lewis has written a book that addresses a real gap in our culture; he understands masculinity particularly Christian masculinity.  Go for it dad!
Perry Mason mysteries are always dependably interesting and fast moving and &quot;The Case of the Lonely Heiress&quot; is no exception.  As per usual Perry is defending a client who has been framed and Perry engages in a few unorthodox practices to protect his client.  The client anticipates inheriting wealth from her mother who had nursed a sick man.  The man wrote a will to her leaving the bulk of his fortune.  Needless to say his family did not appreciate the bequest and one of the witnesses to the will is considering changing her testimony to the effect she did not witness the signing.  Murder enters within the confines of this thick plot.<br />It is not easy to figure out &quot;who done it&quot; but Perry assisted by Della Street and with minimal help from Paul Drake manages to frustrate Lieu. Tragg once again.  You can't go wrong with any Perry Mason mystery but this one had an extra touch of human interest.
The author Josh Harris is a college-aged thoroughly Christian young man who determined to discard traditional dating patterns and practice old-fashioned &quot;courtship.&quot;<br />Courtship involves avoiding romantic involvement until one is in a position to consider marriage.  Although friendship in group activities and particular service ministries is encouraged &quot;coupling' is to be avoided until a young man is able to support a family. At that point the young man does not merely date a girl but he gets involved with her family.<br />The book is divided into four sections but a two-fold division seems more obvious.  Chapters one through three deal with what the author perceives is defective in common dating.  The rest of the book (chapters 4-16) is more or less a &quot;how to&quot; bookdealing with how to develop an alternative approach to finding a spouse and related issues when one chooses a courtship approach toward finding a mate.<br />The author's reasoning is extremely logical and it is amazing to see such a young man possess such  mature insights into human nature. His thinking is crystal clear.  Yet he is amazingly sensitive to the emotional issues and difficulties teens and young adults experience.  He does address them.<br />Harris writes much that is quotable but my favorite line is this one:  &quot;The human heart doesn't like taking orders from the mind&quot; (p.136).  Indeed with the wisdom of the young Josh Harris I cannot imagine what monumental works  he will produce when older!<br />The only negative I noted in this well-written book is that the author rightly states that he does not believe dating to be a sin yet later implies that those who have forsaken dating are more enlightened.  Courtship might be a great way to reduce heartaches emotional traumas and sexual sin as well as increase the potential for successful marriage but all of us must keep in mind that godly people can and do disagree over these matters.<br />A caution: this book tells it like it is and may not be suitable for younger teens. I highly recommend that at least one parent of every teen consider the material in this book and that middle teens be asked to consider what this volume says.  A lot--an awful lot--has changed in the last 20 years and anything that can help us get our heads out the sand is helpful.<br />Many parents and teens may chose to follow Josh Harris' advice but even those who choose otherwise may make some changes in their philosophy of dating after perusing this work./>A caution: this book tells it like it is and may not be suitable for younger teens.

As a pastor of 22 years I highly recommend this commentary. MacArthur is noted to take interpretation seriously but does not stop there: he also adds illustration and application.<br /><br />Many commentaries sidestep difficult passages intimidating one from asking the hard questions as though one were foolish to do so; MacArthur does nothing of the kind but tackles the Scriptures head on asks the difficult questions and presents what he considers the best solution. In essence his \\"no nonsense ingorance is not bliss\\" personality is reflected in his writings. He is neither mindless nor beyond comprehension.<br /><br />The work is thorough and probably my favorite all-around commentary on I Corinthians. It is both practical and scholarly yet readable and understandable by the serious layman. It is written by a pastor who is also a thinker governed by good hermeneutics. His perspective is conservative evangelical dispensational and non-charismatic. You may not agree with every one of his interpretations but you will respect the logical approach that went behind them. Top notch.
Ackerman's brief work (101 pages) offers insights as to how psychology (of course there are so MANY schools of psychology; perhaps it is better to say &quot;psychological theories that do not downplay the preponderance of evil intrinsic within people&quot;:)) supports the Biblical perspective of fallen human nature and creation in general.<br />Chapters include topics not often covered among them:  Normal Unhappiness (worth the price of the book itself) Moral Inconsistencies and The Reality of Choice.<br />The chapter about &quot;Normal Unhappiness&quot; claims that most people have an emotional thermostat that maintains a &quot;moderately unhappy&quot; setting.  When great things happen they are high for a while but then settle down to that setting.  When tragedy occurs they tend to get down for a while and then work up to it.<br />As a pastor of 22 years who has dealt with people at all levels (visiting the babies at the hospital teaching kids counseling marrying visiting in the home the hospital and conducting funerals) I will vouch that the author has an authentic view of the realities of human nature.  It fits with &quot;what is.&quot;  Go for it.
Adams does a thorough job of harmonizing the various Scriptural passages that deal with marriage divorce remarriage and church discipline.  He is clear scholarly and does not strain the texts.<br />His understanding of Scripture leads to the viewpoint that divorce does break marriage though sin is always at the root of divorce.  Remarriage is allowable for desertion or adultery.<br />As a pastor of 22 years I have used Adams' book for over 20 of those years and recommended it to others.  Since the book is so closely tied to Scripture and since Adams' interpretative instinct is sharp and objective I have seen several minister friends won over to Adams' perspective.<br />More importantly I have used this work in my counseling ministry repeatedly and keep a supply on hand for loaning purposes.  If you want one good book about these issues make it this one.
Walvoord interprets through a Premillennial Pretribulational Dispensational grid and I personally appreciate this.  This is a very solid work.  It falls somewhere between a survey and thorough commentary.  Although Walvoord leaves a lot of questions unanswered he does establish and deal with the clear pattern of Matthew the Kingdom offered rejected the mystery form of the kingdom and the church age announced details of Christ's second coming and then the commission to spread the gospel to all the world.<br /><br />This will provide the Bible student with an understanding of Matthew's flow and answer many questions especially reguarding eschatology.  For the pastor who wants a thorough verse by verse work however this volume would not be ideal.
Warren Wiersbe is gifted as a Bible teacher.  His &quot;Be&quot; series books are understandable to the average laymen yet he fearlessly tackles interpretation and application of the text.<br />This book is great for personal study sermon preparation a home Bible study or even a Sunday School class.<br />The author holds to the inspiration/inerrancy and practicality of the Bible.  Wiersbe approaches the Thessalonian epistles from a Premillennial Pretribulational position.  Top notch for the laymen Bible teacher or pastor.  I have pastored over 22 years and I have time and time again found his works useful.  Thessalonians is one of this best.
This volume is invaluable for pastors teachers of the Word or laymen serious about studying the life of Christ.  It addresses the year of Christ's birth the year of His death and Resurrection (as well as the days of both of the above) and even deals with the sequence of Daniel's 70 weeks.  I have used this book for 22 years of pastoral ministry; it is on my list of books I refuse to loan out because I never want to be without it. The work is conservative scholarly and leads to clear summaries and conclusions.  A must have reference book!
This harmony follows the tradition (but some differing paragraph divisions) of Broadus' classic work.  It is top notch for several reasons: (1) it uses the modern English NIV (2) it provides a continuous story line courtesy of bold-face type; one may follow the bold type and not miss a jot or tittle of information reguarding the life of Jesus and (3) it is well laid out: the paper is thick very white and the font of the text comfortable to the eye.<br /><br />There are some other fine harmonies available but if you can only get one I would recommend this one.
Sande has done a wonderful job compiling and applying the Bible's teaching about peacemaking.  As an attorney and solid Christian Sande holds a realistic view about forgiveness and human nature.<br /><br />The book includes endorsements by some of evangelical Christianity's finest including Jay Adams.  Practical Biblical in touch with the way things really are this is the authoritative book about peacemaking.
What happens when a woman chooses to remain in a marriage involving verbal abuse or even unfaithfulness--for the sake of her children?  Most books write her off as co-dependent and offer no direction.<br /><br />Yet with recent information from Wallerstein's study we have come to realize that children are often better off raised in such environments than if parents were divorced.  And some are willing to pay such a price for their little ones.  Others have hope that things will change down the road--how does one cope in the meantime?  Everyone it seems avoids addressing these questions--except for Gary Chapman.<br /><br />Chapman's direction is practical.  He also helps counselors/pastors accept that fact that some problems have no solutions and just have to be accepted if the marriage is to continue.<br /><br />As a pastor of 22 years I take off my hat to Chapman for he is the first to address these realities.  Good stuff.
Trying to summarize the Talmud in a paperback is quite an undertaking but Steinsalz has provided readers with a taste of the Talmud's wisdom.<br /><br />Steinsalz clarifies some interesting distinctions.  For example women were exempted from certain legal responsibilities out of concern for their limitations in rearing children etc. but not forbidden from many of them (e.g. going to the Temple for the Feasts).<br /><br />I write as a Christian pastor whose interest lies in the Jewish roots of my particular faith.  So whether investigating Judaism as a Jew or whether probing into the Talmud as a non-Jew this book is a valuable distillation.
Mosley has written a practical book about prayer and receiving answers to prayer.  In some ways the book is very freeing.  He advocates following the New Testament example of praying for people we know (vs. someone's second cousin from who knows where).  He also encourages us to ask for answers in small steps as per New Testament example.  Rather than praying just for Sally to be saved pray that she comes to church this Sunday or that you will have an opportunity to share with her this week.<br />Mosley deals with some of the doubts questions and frustrations of prayer in a positive uplifting way.  As a veteran pastor I have recommended this book repeatedly.  Great material simple Scriptural and practical.
God forgives us conditionally upon our repentance.  God does not hold us to a higher standard than he holds himself.  We forgive others in the same way God forgives us.<br /><br />The authors do a fine job of discussing the many questions raised in our minds about forgiveness and they look at the whole of Scripture to find answers.  Unlike some books based more on pop psychology this book is true to the Word.  God's way is a lot more freeing than the \\"pretend you've forgiven when you haven't in the name of love\\" approach often advocated today.  The best book I've found on forgiveness.<br /><br />As a pastor of 22 years I have preached and counseled these principles.  Guilty consciences have been relieved and offenders have truly repented and became willing to re-establish credibility.  American evangelicalism needs this book!  A must for anyone who ministers to people--including dedicated laymen.
Getz' book is sorely needed in a day when human opinion and experience as to &quot;what works&quot; has supplanted the Biblical directives as to what the church should be according to the Word of God.<br />Getz presents a balanced and thorough study of what church is about the evangelism of the lost (in the world) and the edification of believers (in our gatherings).<br />He presents principles drawn directly from inductive study and even presents appendices filled with verse after verse to document his conclusions.<br />This books serves as a blueprint (since it is anchored to Scripture) for churches bent on pleasing God.  If you can dig up a copy of this one dig it up!
This remarkable little book offers prayers near to the heart of Christian leaders.  As a pastor I have marvelled at how well my thoughts concerns burdens fears and frustrations are shared by the author.  He directs the prayers to the Father with clarity and wrestling of heart.<br /><br />If you are a pastor head of a Christian organization or involved in shepherding or leadership these prayers may put into words the cries of your heart.  Superb.
This book contains 440 pages of generally short jokes arranged by topic.  They are clean ideally sized and quite a few of them are funny.  I have seen jokes in this volume that are unique not just the same old same old (though half or so I've seen elsewhere--for me that's a good per centage).<br />I have found them useful in writing newspaper editorials preaching and puppet skits.  Lots of good church/Christian related humor.
This prayer book is written from a conservative Lutheran perspective but most of these prayers can be used and appreciated by all evangelicals.<br /><br />The prayers are worded in modern English clear not flowery but reverential.  The prayers evidence belief in a Savior Who wants to be known personally.  There are several groupings of prayers:  morning and evening Christian living worship family life various occupations national/international life sickness and other categories.<br /><br />Some of these prayers are adaptable for pulpit use.  Great for family devotions and getting out of a rut in ones private life.  Sadly the 235 little pages do not provide a volume of daily prayers.  It's a shame this isn't a multi-volume set.

As a minister of 31 years I first read this book about a dozen years ago.  It helped me communicate better to my wife friends and congregation.<br /><br />Since that time I have loaned copies to numerous people I have counseled (I have a stack of these) and many have been helped through putting this book in practice.<br /><br />Backus encourages direct and honest communication.  He deals with the lies we tell ourselves that keep us from speaking truthfully and directly.  Besides aiding in communication skills the principles mentioned will also increase personal sincerity and integrity.<br /><br />Practical easy to read illustrated with case studies this is a must read for all Christians.
As a pastor I find the ISBE a wonderful tool not only for study but for ideas.  Material from articles on subjects like \\"peace\\" or \\"conscience\\" provide information and insights not available elsewhere.<br /><br />The ISBE contributors represent various evangelical positions.  The set often includes articles that are barely evangelical contributors frequently holding to inspiration but not inerrancy. Though I find myself more conservative than many of the contributors I find the insights invaluable and the thinking scholarly.  There's not a lot of the same old same old surface info but depth and even some original thinking.<br /><br />Highly reommended for students of the Word with a note of caution to those of us on the conservative end of evangelicalism.
Leon Wood has written an ideal commentary on Judges.  It is solidly conservative scholarly but not tedious or trivial and thorough.<br /><br />It's emphasis is interpretation of the text not preaching material.  Wood interprets objectively and with reason always with reverence for the Word of God.  Like most thorough commentaries this is a reference book and not intended for popular reading though understandable by serious laymen.  Highly recommended.
The cream of the crop--Henny Youngman's best one liners.  I have several Henny Youngman joke books but this is the best one.<br />I do not appreciate off-color humor and there are a few jokes of that variety but most of them are clean--and funny.<br />How about this one:  &quot;My doctor's such a nice guy.  I couldn't afford an operation so he touched up the X-ray.&quot;<br />Short but very funny.
This book is filled with many ideally sized jokes arranged by numerous topic.  Although I do not appreciate off-color jokes most of those are avoidable by avoiding the off-color topics.<br />I have used many of these jokes in writing and speaking and highly recommend this as perhaps the funniest large-volume jokebook.
Maxwell has some good things to say properly defining leadership as influence.  Many of his &quot;laws&quot; of leadership are helpful and he writes well with good illustrations. There is a simplicity and concrete-ness to this book.<br />I do have a serious problem with the fact that Maxwell advocates removing dependable faithful qualified people from their ministries if better individuals can be found.  It is important in church leadership to reward qualities like dependability faithfulness hard work and virtue.  Christian leadership is not secular leadership with prayer attached.  Success in God's eyes is not the same as numerical or financial growth.<br />In a society that needs but is repelled by stability and prefers constant thrills change and enthusiasm it is important for Christian leaders to model the qualities that keep people married consistently growing stable and pillar-like.  If we model a &quot;greener pastures&quot; approach toward those under us can we condemn those who follow the same principle in other areas like marriage for instance?<br />There are deeper books on this subject such as &quot;The Ascent of A Leader&quot; that are more thoughtfully and distinctly Christian.  Is this book worth reading?  Yes you will gain some insights.  But think and evaluate as you read: do not assume that a famous Christian leader is necessarily in perfect tune with God's perspective.
George Barna has written some excellent books but this is not one of his best.  It is very much like many books about church growth.  If you are not well-read on this subject you might enjoy this book more than I.<br />Barna's strength is his diagnosis of trouble.  His solutions arein my view weak.  When dealing with church growth in general one has to ask the question &quot;If I have to do such and such and have a church that is such and such is it worth having this kind of church at all?  Is this a Christianity WORTH reproducing?&quot;
Barna's surveys and studies provide church leaders with a dependable source of diagnosis.  Barna's expertise lies in his ability to pinpoint exactly what is happening.<br />I place much trust in Barna's ability to diagnose.  His suggested solutions however I disagree with.  We can offer teaching to our people for instance but what do we do with all the people who claim to be believers but yet refuse to excercise their minds?<br />My advice:  read Barna to diagnose that is his specialty.  The treatment that lies elsewhere perhaps as a combination from Os Guiness in &quot;Fit Bodies Fat Minds&quot; Gene Getz's classic &quot;Sharpening the Focus of the Church&quot; and even the secular &quot;Bowling Alone&quot; by Robert Putnam.
Pentecost does a fine job of summarizing and anlayzing the meaning of the parables in a consistently clear manner. Penetecost is solidly conservative and evangelical. The analysis is brief but to the point. The interpretations are solid and dependable.<br /><br />For interpretation this book deserves a 5 star rating. It is however a bit dry which is why I rate it as a 4 rather than 5 star.
This is a fine book that is both realistic and practical.  Chapman understands teenagers and offers advice as though it were given by Solomon.<br />Chapman is balanced and Biblical.  He shows an understanding of individuality and human nature.  As a pastor of 20 years I recommend this book to anyone who has teenagers.
Understanding the Jewish Roots of the Christian faith is a relatively new pursuit.  Young's work certainly offers a major contribution in this field; it is clear easy to understand and enlightening.<br /><br />He offers insights into various passages and the passages come to light sometimes illuminated by understanding the Jewish background to a teaching or event.<br /><br />As a pastor preparing a 3 years seromn series on the Life of Christ this was one book offered me fresh (but conservative)insights.  Worth your time.
As an evangelical pastor I agree with the author's theme that many believers hold the mind in contempt; people want to feel not think. Yet the emphasis of Scripture is that lives are transformed as minds are renewed (Rom.12:2).<br />The evangelical world is in trouble: we have a higher divorce rate and a higher bankruptcy rate than society at large. Few will address this problem seriously because few will acknowledge that there really is a problem--at least a serious one.<br />Guiness has hit the nail on the head. Our churches are dumbed-down and we have a long history of contempt for thinking. This book is a must for all who recognize that all is not well within evangelicalism.<br />There are times the author is unfair as for example in his chapter about premillennialists. When many amillennial seminaries were denying the faith it was the premillennial movement that became the bastion for solid doctrine. Among the non-feeling oriented premillennialists doctrine and truth are often quite valued.<br />Despite some pet aggravations the author mishandles this book is a MUST and should serve as a blueprint for changing course into a better direction. We must no longer applaud ignorance and view thinking as \\"heartless.\\" Read this book!!!
I am a pastor who is not charismatic so I am somewhat sympathetic to the author's viewpoints.  But I cannot recommend this book because in my opinion he strains the Scriptures to prove his point.  We all may have agendas when we go into Scripture study but one must arrive at conclusions the right way (with a genuine openess to the meaning of Scripture).<br /><br />John MacArthur's book \\"The Charmismatics\\" would be a much better read.  MacArthur comes to similar conclusions but treats the Scriptures with fairness not straining them.
This book is not particularly readable.  It was originally written in 1956 in a tedious and uninviting style almost reminiscient of the 19th century.  Despite the book's format the information it contains makes it extremely valuable to the New Testament interpretter.  It helps open up several passages and concepts.   My favorite chapter deals with the \\"Laying on of Hands.\\"  It distinguishes between the two Old Testament words one of which means to lay ones hands upon another lightly (as in a blessing) the other meaning to press with weight; this second term was used for sacrifices and signified the creating of a substitute and the transfer of sin by leaning into the sacrifice.  One is pressing oneself into another.  You can see how this sets the stage for the New Testament teaching regarding how Christ bore our sins as our substitute.  Faith then becomes a matter of \\"leaning\\" upon Christ.  Perhaps this might be considered more of a reference work or a book to skim through in search of tasty nuggets.  But for the serious student there are some diamonds to be mined here.
Dr. Moseley's volume is a well written thorougly documented understandable work with an important message:  one cannot understand the Gospels or the early church with precision unless one enters into the Jewish roots of the Christian faith.<br /><br />Besides being a true scholar and theologian Dr. Moseley also serves as a pastor and his pastoral experience has probably contributed toward his ability to explain complex thoughts with clarity and precision.<br /><br />The book is divided into nine chapters my favorite being the second \\"Jewish Idioms in the Teachings of Jesus.\\"  This chapter opens up several Gospel portions and alone is worth the purchase price of the book.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with the author on every point this volume will expose you to the Jewish roots of the Christian faith while also opening up a number of Gospel or New Testament passages.  As a pastor of over 20 years and a diligent student of the Word (who values good interpretational principles) I say this book is a must for pastors theologians or serious laymen.  This is by no means the \\"same old same old.\\"  Go for it.
Warren Wiersbe is one of the great Bible teachers of all time.  He interprets and applies the truth on a popular level without compromising depth.  Be Joyful his commentary on Philippians is his best work in my opinion.<br /><br />He reveals the four thieves of joy (one for each chapter of Philippians) and then counters them with the four \\"minds\\" we are to develop.  Simple clearcut balanced and practical.  A must read.
This work is the best commentary on the Minor Prophets from a conservative dispensational premillennial viewpoint.  The work is ideally suited for pastors or serious Bible students.  It is not tedious but definitely scholarly and well researched.<br /><br />The strength of this book is its purpose interpretation.  It is not intended to be a popular commentary with an accent on application but seeks to focus upon discerning the text.  Yet it does not get tedious with grammatical overkill.<br /><br />As a pastor of over 20 years it is the first book I reach for (after my Bible) when studying the Minor Prophets.  I rarely sense a need to reach for another.
Wiersbe's autobiography is a pleasure to read.  Many of us respect him as a great Bible teacher but one reason his teaching ministry is so effective is that Wiersbe is PERSONABLE.  His personableness comes out in his life's story.<br />We often think of great Bible teachers as somehow belonging to a different level of humanity.  Wiersbe destroys that illusion with a real flesh and blood picture of himself a man whose idea of exercising is walking to the library and who experiences both the joys and aggravations of people.  Good reading.
As an evangelical pastor I have often been puzzled as to why so many individuals seem to be constantly discontent and virtually friendless.  Putnam has offered answers to these and a whole slew of other relational questions even if not intentionally.<br />Putnam's thesis is that personal happiness health crime SAT Scores and the well being of our country revolve around whether or not individuals participate in groups read the paper and even attend church.  Many influences especially television have disconnected Americans from one another.  Putnam puts his finger on one of America's mega-problems.  Although I may not agree with every iota  Putnam is definitely on the ball.  This is a must read for pastors social workers counselors civic servants and anyone who cares about our nation at large!
This prayer book is the best all around prayer book for daily personal (or even family)use.  The Scriptures are addressed back to God and arranged by category (with direction to add certain categories of requests inbetween the sections).  This adds structure to ones prayer life and breaks the monotony of \\"grocery list\\" praying.  This one is a little longer than \\"Praying the Scriptures for Spiritual Growth\\" or the \\"Simple Prayers\\" books; in my own personal devotions it takes me about 7 minutes per daily prayer segment.<br /><br />Boa has written several prayer books all great all solid.  This is my favorite to date.
As a pastor I have recommended the Ryrie Study Bible since it was first released in the later 1970's.  The revised edition is even better than its predecessor with in-text maps charts and Ryrie's most unique feature: prolific interpretative notes at the foot of almost every page.<br /><br />When folks ask me Bible questions as their pastor if I do not have the answer in my head more times than not the notes provide the answer (makes me look good!).  And the maps and indexes are unique.<br /><br />The Ryrie Study Bible is doctrinally based upon a literal view of the Bible.  It is Dispensational Premillennial Eternally Secure and Non-charismatic.  But Evangelical Christians of various positions will find it very helpful indeed.  The best study version of the best Book of all time!
While listening to Moody Radio's \\"Mid-day Connection\\" I was impressed by the program's guest former attorney and now stay-at-home mom Christine Field.  She answered callers questions about child-rearing and development with such wisdom I decided I must read her book.<br /><br />\\"Life Skills for Kids\\" is most appropriate for those who have children from toddler age to about age 12.  The premise of the book is that parents need specific direction in preparing their young ones for adult life in the real world.<br /><br />Rather than \\"subcontracting\\" our children to others Field advocates taking the bull the horns and offering our children plenty of direction. The book is arranged around fourteen \\"Maxims of Maturity.\\" In short they are:<br /><br />1. Responsibility begins in small things and it should be timed well. 2. Children must learn to get along with others and to resolve and manage conflict on their own. 3. Everyone lives somewhere.  We need to take care of that place. 4. It's a big and sometimes uncertain world and our children need to know how to navigate it safely. 5. We must use our time wisely. 6. We need to manage our work and living space wisely. 7. Things break and need maintenance.  The more we can learn to do on our own the more self-reliant we will be. 8. Money: either we learn to handle it or it will handle us. 9. Each of us has only one body we need to learn to take care of it. 10. A brain is a valuable thing.  We should aim to make it work at peak performance. 11. If God is not the center of our life it will ultimately be unsatisfying. 12. The more decisions we make the better decision makers we become. 13. We can all develop and nourish creativity. 14. Celebrate rejoice and be glad!  This day is all we have.<br /><br />Field gets to the point when she discusses teaching our children \\"people skills.\\"  She writes:<br /><br />\\"One of the greatest gifts we can give our children is the knowledge that the universe does not revolve around them.....We tend to indulge our children out of love for them but love is not indulgence.  Love is training your children and sometimes being tough with them asking them to learn unselfishness being strong enough to tolerate their not liking you when you try to do the right thing....this ability to look beyond oneself is a critical people skill.\\"<br /><br />The book is filled with both concepts and specifics even detailing how to mix homemade cleaners which are safe for children's chores.  The author is balanced and thorough.  She is neither too strict nor too lax realizing on one hand the value of play creative time and freedom to make decisions while on the other hand acknowledging the need for responsibility and accountability.<br /><br />As far as goals and direction go the book is through.  Though the author has attempted to direct her book toward Christian families in general her advice (great as it is) is based upon her personal family life. Since Field is a homeschool mom so she does not address particular concerns unique to public school families or families with moms who work outside the home.  Despite a gap or two this book is a must read for all Christian parents whose children are between ages 2 and 12.for them but love is not indulgence.

As an evangelical pastor who collects prayer books for use in personal  devotions and for use from the pulpit I have found &quot;Prayers to Move  Mountains&quot; to be the best I have seen thus far.<br />The prayers are  written simply in plain English but are nonetheless beautiful.  They have  substance are anchored to Scripture and though written for personal  prayer times are easily adapted for groups.  The prayers are pretty much  mainstream evangelical/fundamental with a slight charismatic twist in a few  of them and the few prayers which may reflect a variation from the readers  point of view may be easily adjusted.  I am a non-charismatic and only feel  I need to slightly adjust a handful of the prayers.<br />The book contains  108 practical and reverential prayers divided into 11 categories each  prayer about 2 short pages long.  The  categories are: Worshiping God for  Who He is Thanking God for What He Has Done Becoming More Like Jesus  Sin Stress Marriage and Family The Lives of Your Children  Relationships Job and Career Sickness and Disease and Bringing in the  Kingdom of God.<br />If you are a Bible-oriented Christian you will  appreciate this prayer book.  Go for it.
Christianity has its roots in Judaism and David Stern proves that there her roots must remain.  Although the Apostles agreed that gentile believers in the Messiah need not become Jewish later church councils decided that  believers in Messiah could no longer be Jewish.  But the evidence of  Scripture clearly points out that first century believers had no problem  continuing an identification as a \\"sect of the Jews.\\"<br /><br />Stern  demonstrates how the Church an outgrowth of Judaism cut itself off from  its roots and has suffered because of it.<br /><br />Although a few interpretations  are strained (esp. his interpretation of the relationship of the Law to New  Testament believers in Galatians) the book is a real eye opener.  Anybody  who values Bible interpretation would do well to read it esp. pastors and  professors though it is understandable to a serious laymen.<br /><br />This book  will stretch your mind and help you to \\"see\\" passages you never  \\"saw.\\"  As a serious student of the Word pastor of 20 years  and someone who values thoughtful interpretation I say this book is a  must.
David Stern has done a remarkable job intepretting the New Testament from a Messianic Jewish perspective.  His expertise in Jewish culture tradition and belief bring fresh insights to the student of the New  Testament.<br /><br />He sometimes quotes from the Talmud or other ancient sources  that help amplify New Testament comments.  His understanding of Jesus  Paul and the Apostles as Jewish help us discern what was in the author's  mind one of the goals of good interpretation.<br /><br />Though the commentary is  not thorough or greatly detailed many of its insights are not just the  same old recirculated ones found in most commentaries.  Stern's work is  not just a large research paper but offers material that is unique.<br /><br />As a  pastor of over 20 years and a serious student of the Word I consider this  work invaluable and would not want to be without it.
I have used portions of these prayers in preparing my pastoral prayers and some of them are useful but they could theologically deeper.  Still they are helpful for the evangelical pastor.
The prayers in this book should be well received by all Bible-believing congregations.  They are clear to the point and God-centered.<br />The only negative about the book is that it is short.  Highly recommended!
This is perhaps the best pastoral prayer book I have found thus far.  Although the wording can occasionally tangle one up with a few revisions these prayers have a good mix between focusing on God as well as the needs  of the congregation.<br />Those of us who consider ourselves Bible-believing  can use most of these prayers freely; they are solidly evangelical but  appropriate for non-Lutherans like myself.
Has many favorite Berlin songs arranged for guitar; but a disappointment for piano players:  only has melody line not arranged in four part harmonies.
